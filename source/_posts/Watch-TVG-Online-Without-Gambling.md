The service also includes exclusive features, such as audio commentary from jockeys and trainers, as well as past performances and betting insights.

TVG Race Pass is available now on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

#  How to Watch TVG Without Being in a State That Authorizes Gambling

If you're in a state that doesn't authorize gambling and you want to watch TVG, there are a few ways to do it. You can use a VPN, but you'll need to be careful about the provider you choose. Some VPNs are known for being leaky and may not be secure enough to keep your identity hidden.

Another option is to use an IP proxy. This is a service that will connect you to an IP address in a state that does allow gambling. This is a great option if you want to keep your location private, but it can be more expensive than a VPN.

Finally, you can use a DNS proxy. This is a service that changes the way your internet traffic is routed. It's not as reliable as a VPN or an IP proxy, but it's cheaper and easier to set up.

No matter which option you choose, be sure to research the provider before signing up. Make sure they have strong security features and that they won't leak your information.

#  How to Watch TVG Online If You Live in a State That Doesn't Authorize Gambling

It can be a real bummer when you want to watch TVG online but your state doesn't authorize gambling. But don't worry, there are still a few ways to get around this and watch the race without having to leave your house.

The first option is to use a VPN service. This will essentially trick TVG into thinking that you are located in a state where gambling is legal. There are a number of different VPN services that you can use, so you should be able to find one that fits your budget and needs.

Another option is to use Smart DNS Proxy. This service works in a similar way to VPNs, but it is slightly cheaper and easier to set up. However, it may not be as reliable as some of the other options out there.

Finally, you could also try using an unofficial streaming site. These sites are not affiliated with TVG, but they often provide high-quality streams of the races. Just be aware that using these sites can be risky, as they may contain malware or other harmful content.
