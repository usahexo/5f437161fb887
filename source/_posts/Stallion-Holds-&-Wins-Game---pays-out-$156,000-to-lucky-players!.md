When you consider the allure of James Bond, it is largely due to the character’s Britishness. The martinis, the dry humor, the Savile Row suits - it’s all very 007. But how did the newspapers know Bond was British in the first place? After all, he is a fictional character.

The book was published in 1953 and at that time, casinos were tightly regulated by the government. This meant that any big winnings would be announced in local newspapers.

So there you have it - Bond was British because of his casino winnings! While this may not be the most thrilling aspect of his character, it is certainly an interesting piece of trivia.
