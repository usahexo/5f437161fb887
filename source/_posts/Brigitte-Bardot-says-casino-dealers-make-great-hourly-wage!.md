#  Brigitte Bardot says casino dealers make great hourly wage!

In a recent interview with the French publication Paris Match, Brigitte Bardot criticized the French government for failing to do more to protect animals. She also had some complimentary words for casino dealers, who she said make a great hourly wage.

"The dealers in casinos earn more than policemen!," exclaimed Bardot. "It's scandalous!"

She went on to say that while casino dealers may not have the same social status as police officers, they are invaluable to society.

"They (casino dealers) keep our society going! They are the ones who make sure that everything works properly. We need them!"

Bardot is no stranger to controversy, but her comments about casino dealers have been largely well-received in France. Many people agree that these hardworking professionals deserve better pay and recognition.

#  How much does a casino dealer make? It's great hourly pay!

Casino dealers make some of the best hourly wages in the entire world of work. In most cases, casino dealers can expect to make $10-$25 per hour. This is a great wage for just about any position, but especially so for one that doesn't require a great deal of formal education.

Most casino dealers do not have to have a college degree to find work in this field. Instead, many dealers are required to complete only a short training program that covers the basics of dealing cards and running a table. With just a little bit of training under your belt, you could easily be on your way to making great money as a casino dealer.

What's even better is that the hours tend to be pretty good too. In most cases, casino dealers are able to work evening and weekend shifts, which means they can avoid the dreaded nine-to-five grind. This also allows them more time to spend with their families and friends outside of work.

If you're looking for a well-paying job with decent hours and few formal requirements, then becoming a casino dealer may be the perfect fit for you!

#  Casino dealers: Great hourly pay, thanks to Brigitte Bardot!

Casino dealers are some of the best-paid hourly workers in the world, thanks to the influence of French actress Brigitte Bardot.

Bardot, who was considered one of the most beautiful women in the world in the 1950s and 1960s, famously posed for a series of pinup shots while working as a casino dealer in Monte Carlo. The images were later published as a photo spread in Playboy magazine, and helped to cement the reputation of casino dealers as high-paid professionals.

Since then, dealers around the world have enjoyed excellent pay and benefits packages, thanks to Bardot's pioneering work. In Las Vegas, for example, dealers can expect to earn an hourly wage of around $20 - more than double the average wage in the city.

There are many reasons for this high rate of pay. For starters, casinos are usually located in popular tourist destinations, meaning that dealers can enjoy good tips from grateful guests. In addition, casinos are often open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, meaning that dealers can often work long hours and earn significant overtime pay.

Finally, casinos are highly competitive businesses and are always looking to attract talented staff. This means that dealers can often negotiate excellent pay and benefits packages from their employers.

So if you're looking for a well-paid hourly job with great working conditions, consider becoming a casino dealer!
