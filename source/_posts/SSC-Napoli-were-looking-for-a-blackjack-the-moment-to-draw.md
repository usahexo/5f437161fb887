SSC Napoli went into the match knowing that they needed to win in order to keep their slim hopes of Champions League qualification alive. However, they were toothless in the final third and failed to score, as they drew 0-0 with Fiorentina.

Napoli started brightly, but it was Fiorentina who had the first real chance of the game. Nikola Milenkovic headed over from a corner kick. The home side then had a great chance to take the lead, but José Callejón's effort was saved by Alban Lafont. Napoli continued to create chances but they could not find a way past Lafont.

Fiorentina almost took the lead in the second half, but Arkadiusz Milik's effort hit the post. Napoli then nearly won it in stoppage time, but David Ospina made a great save to deny Giovanni Simeone. Napoli therefore had to be content with a point, which leaves them six points adrift of fourth-placed Inter Milan with just four games remaining.

Napoli interim manager Giampiero Ventura was not happy with the draw: "I'm not satisfied with the result because we didn't get a victory that would have put us back in contention for fourth place. We need to do better and I will take this opportunity to ask for more from my players."

#  Blackjack as soon as to draw SSC Napoli 

The Napoli membership affiliation has seen its justifiable share of peaks and valleys all over the years. one in every of the lows that the membership has visible is once they have been relegated to the second division in Serie B throughout the 2005-06 season. The then president,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Aurelio De Laurentiis, acted shortly and appointed Pierpaolo Marino as director of soccer operations. below Marino’s management, Napoli made an instantaneous comeback to Serie A and even reached top-of-the-line 4 within the 2009-10 season.

one in every of Marino’s first moves was once to signal Marek Hamsik from Brescia in January 2007. Hamsik had performed properly at Brescia and Napoli became one among a handful of golf equipment inquiring about him. as soon as he joined Napoli, he didn’t look back and has develop into one among their legends.

Hamsik has scored 91 goals for Napoli within the league which locations him 3rd on their all-time checklist, regardless of now not enjoying for them for his or her first three seasons. His excellent online game for Napoli got here when they played Juventus at Juventus Stadium in 2015. He netted a hat trick within the first thirty minutes and led Napoli to a 4-2 victory. round that very same time, Juventus supervisor Massimiliano Allegri labelled him as “an artists” who was once “capable of making things happen on the pitch by himself.”

Hamsik netted twice over two legs and set up one other purpose to make sure his nation’s spot in Russia subsequent yr.

despite being one among Europe’s high midfielders, Hamsik didn’t get a lot love from referees all over his career resulting in 10 sending offs; which makes him one in every of most punished gamers ever within the Champions League/EURO Cup competitions (alongside with Andres Iniesta). but this might now not be a difficulty for long as he prepares to retire from worldwide soccer after the World Cup in Russia subsequent yr so he can focal point on Napoli full-time again.

#  SS Lazio hope SSC Napoli don't find blackjack the moment to draw 

The build-up to the final weeks of the Serie A season is always exciting, but even more so this year as SS Lazio and SSC Napoli go head to head for the title. The two teams are level on points, but Napoli hold the advantage with a game in hand. 

Lazio fans will be hoping that their side can hold onto their lead and take home their first Scudetto since 2000. However, they will need to be careful not to get complacent – as we have seen in previous seasons, anything can happen in the final weeks of the campaign. 

One thing that could work in Lazio’s favour is the fact that Napoli have been known to drop points towards the end of the season. In fact, they have only won one out of their last four games, while Lazio have won their last three. 

It is also worth noting that Napoli’s away form has not been great recently. They have only picked up six points from their last five games on the road, while Lazio have managed ten points from five matches at home. 

Napoli will be desperate to win on Sunday and take one step closer to the title, but they will face a tough task against a Lazio side who are in great form. This should be an exciting game and it is certainly going to be fascinating to see who comes out on top.

#  Lorenzo Insigne hoping SSC Napoli live up to blackjack expectations 

The Serie A club are looking to improve on their seventh-place finish from last season and Lorenzo Insigne is hoping they can do so with a change in luck at the casino.

“We want to do better than last season. We know that we can and we will work hard to achieve it,” said Lorenzo Insigne. “Playing at the casino will help us as well. We hope to get as close to 21 as possible.”

One of Napoli’s biggest threats this season could come from their new signing Arkadiusz Milik who joins the side after impressing for Ajax last season. Milik is expected to lead the line for Napoli this season and with Gonzalo Higuain now in Madrid, there is a lot of pressure on his shoulders.

“I don’t feel any extra pressure because Gonzalo has left, I just want to do my best for the team like I always have done,” said Milik. “I think we have a strong squad here and I can’t wait to start playing with my new teammates. The blackjack games here in Napoli are always intense but hopefully we can get some good results this season.”
