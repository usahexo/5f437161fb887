#  Why Do People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot? 

In almost all variants of baccarat, the value of a hand is its point total. Bets are placed on the player, banker, or tie hands. The aim of the game is to guess which one of these will have a point total as close as possible to 9.

In French, "rien" means "nothing". And so, while in English we might say "zero", in baccarat, the players say "rien" to bet on a hand with no points at all.

Brigitte Bardot was a famous actress and sex symbol during the 1950s and 1960s. She starred in many movies, including Bicycle Thieves (1948) and And God Created Woman (1956). During her career, she was also known for her scandalous personal life. She once said, "I am not ashamed to say that I am a feminist. But I'm not a man-hater."

So why do people say "nothin" in baccarat instead of "zero"? The answer lies in Brigitte Bardot's feminism. In French, "rien" means both "nothing" and "no one". So when players say "rien" in baccarat, they're not only betting on a hand with no points, they're also betting against the other players.

#  The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot 

When players make a bet at the Baccarat table, they are given the option to wager on one of three possible outcomes: Player, Banker, or Tie. Each bet has a different payout odds attached to it. In order to make things simple for players, all of the chips that are wagered will be placed in the middle of the table and divided equally between the Player and Banker bets—this is known as a “street” or “spread” bet.

The game progresses when one of two things happen: either a Player or Banker hand is drawn, or the cards in play reach a total value of 8 or 9 (a natural). If a Player or Banker hand is drawn, then their respective totals are compared and the winner is paid out according to the payout odds attached to their bet. If a natural occurs, then no further drawing takes place and both hands are automatically winners; the payout odds are simply multiplied by two in this instance.

If you’re looking to break down some baccarat lingo, you might hear people refer to a “zero” as “Nothin In Baccarat.” This term comes from when someone places a bet on Banker and the banker hand results in a zero value (either through two identical cards being dealt or by picking up a 0 card). In this instance, the player would lose their banked chip even though no other player hand was involved in the game. To avoid any confusion, simply remember that when someone says “Nothin In Baccarat,” they’re referring to when their chosen bet lost due to an occurrence of zero.

#  What's The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot? 

In the game of Baccarat, some players say "nothin" in place of zero. Why do they do this?

There are a few different explanations for why people say "nothin" instead of zero in Baccarat. One explanation is that "nothin" is easier to say than "zero". Another explanation is that the pronunciation of "zero" sounds like the word "sour", and so players want to avoid saying it.

A third explanation is that the term "nothin" comes from an old French gambling game called Chemin de Fer. In this game, there was a special card called a "null". The null was worth nothing, and so players would say "nothin" when they were referring to this card.

Whatever the reason may be, the term "nothin" is now commonly used in Baccarat to refer to the number zero.

#  A Look At The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot 

There are many different versions of baccarat, but the most common one is the Punto Banco version. The game is played with 6 or 8 decks of cards, and the purpose is to get as close as possible to 9. The number 0 doesn't exist in baccarat, and that's why some people say "nothin" instead of "zero".

The first thing you need to understand about baccarat is that there are three different betting options: player, banker, and tie. The player and banker bets are simply wagers on who will win the hand. The tie bet is a wager on whether or not the hand will end in a draw. If both the player and banker have the same score, it's called a tie and the player wins half of their bet back.

In order to win a hand of baccarat, your final score needs to be either closer to 9 than your opponent's score, or equal to their score. If your final score is 9, it's called a natural and you automatically win. If your final score is 0 (or "nothin"), you lose your bet.

One thing you should keep in mind when playing baccarat is that the house edge is very low. In fact, it's only around 1.06% for the player bet and around 1.24% for the banker bet. This means that you have a decent chance of winning your bet, which is why some people prefer this game over other casino games like blackjack or roulette.

#  Learn About The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot

There is a reason why people say "nothin" in baccarat instead of zero. Brigitte Bardot is the answer. The French actress was considered one of the most beautiful women in the world during her heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. She was often photographed wearing revealing clothing, which led to her being dubbed "sex kitten." Her film career began in 1952 with a small role in Jean-Louis Trintignant's drama Les Amants. She achieved international fame the following year with her performance opposite Marcello Mastroianni in Roger Vadim's controversial drama And God Created Woman.

Bardot went on to star in a number of other successful films, including Sacha Guitry's comedy Pot-Bouille (1957) and Louis Malle's romantic drama Viva Maria! (1965). However, she announced her retirement from acting at the age of 36, after appearing in what would be her last feature film, Esclavage moderne (1975). From then on, she focused on animal rights activism and became a noted international spokeswoman for the protection of animals.

 So why is Brigitte Bardot associated with baccarat? In 1966, she starred in Vie Privée, a French film directed by Louis Malle. The movie features a baccarat scene in which Bardot's character loses over 10 million francs. Because of this infamous scene, Vie Privée is sometimes referred to as "the baccarat movie." Baccarat subsequently gained immense popularity in France as a result of Vie Privée's widespread publicity. And since "nothin" sounds more like "nothin" than "zero," that's how baccarat players came to say "nothin" instead of "zero."
