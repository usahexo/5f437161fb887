#  Casino Dealers Push Winning Tables for Profits 

Casino dealers have a unique opportunity to guide the outcome of their table games in order to make more money. By subtly encouraging players to make certain bets and discouraging others, they can help improve the odds at their table in their favor. While most dealers stick to simply announcing bets and ensuring cards are dealt correctly, some use their position to influence the game.

 Casino insiders say that one dealer at The Venetian Las Vegas was known for his winning tables. With a little encouragement, players would bet on blackjack and roulette games with house odds of 3.5 percent, but he managed to get them up to 6 percent by nudging them in the right direction. Dealers like this can make a lot of extra money for the casino, and it’s completely legal as long as they don’t outright tell players what to do.

dealers will typically “nudge” a player in the right direction by pointing out what seems like an obvious winning bet. For instance, if a player is considering betting on red in roulette, the dealer might say something like “I like your odds on red—it’s been coming up a lot lately.” This type of comment is harmless, and it may even convince the player to make the bet. However, if the dealer says something like “Don’t waste your money on black—it never comes up” then they are crossing the line and directing gameplay.

Dealers can also increase their odds by discouraging players from making bad bets. If a player is thinking about betting on a longshot hand in blackjack, for instance, the dealer might say something like “That’s not really worth your money—I wouldn’t bother if I were you.” This type of advice may cause the player to reconsider their decision and ultimately lose money.

While many people think that casino dealers are simply there to deal cards and collect tips, they actually have a lot of control over the outcome of the game. By using their position to push winning tables, they can make an extra buck or two for themselves and improve casino profits in the process.

#  Casino Dealer Pushes Slot Machine Buttons for Luckier Results 

Casino dealers have been caught pushing buttons on slot machines to make them payout more often. 

The Telegraph reports that casino dealers have been caught on camera pushing the buttons on slot machines to get lucky and make more money for the casino. They would do this by standing behind the machine, and pushing the buttons as if they were playing the game themselves.

One dealer who was caught on camera doing this was working at Grosvenor Casino in Bournemouth, Dorset. The dealer can be seen in a video standing behind a machine and repeatedly pushing the buttons. The machine then proceeds to payout £184 within a few minutes.

The Grosvenor Casino said in a statement: "We can confirm that one of our team members has been shown in a social media video pressing buttons on a gaming machine in what appears to be an attempt to influence its outcome. This is unacceptable behaviour and we take such matters very seriously." 

This isn't the first time that casino dealers have been caught cheating. In 2012, three dealers were caught rigging a slot machine at Caesar's Palace casino in Las Vegas.

#  Dealing a Winning Hand: How Push Strategies Help Casinos Profit 

The casino industry is a billion dollar business, and for good reason. Casinos offer guests the opportunity to experience chance and luck in a controlled environment. In order to keep the odds in their favor, casinos use strategies known as “push” games.

A push game is one in which the house has no statistical advantage over the player. In fact, in some instances, the player has a better chance of winning than the house. This is why casinos make money off these games- not because they have a higher chance of winning, but because players tend to gamble more when they have a chance of winning rather than losing.

There are many different types of push games, but some of the most popular ones include blackjack, craps, and roulette. In blackjack, for example, the dealer must hit on 16 and stand on 17. This gives the player an advantage because the dealer has less chances of going over 21. In craps, players can bet on various outcomes, such as whether or not the shooter will roll a seven or eleven on the next roll. And in roulette, players can bet on red or black, odd or even, or dozens and columns.

While playing these games may seem like a risky proposition for players, casinos know that most people are more likely to risk their money when they have a chance at winning rather than losing. This is why casinos make money off these games- because players are more likely to keep gambling until they lose than walk away with their original bet intact.

#  Do Casino Dealers Push Players Toward Unprofitable Tables? 

The casino industry is worth an estimated $40 billion, and with that large of a market, it’s no wonder casino dealers have been the focus of suspicion for decades. One of the most common casino dealer rumors is that they push players towards tables where the odds are stacked against them, leading to more money for the casino in the long run. 

But is it true? Do casino dealers really push players towards games where the house has the advantage? 

The answer, unfortunately, is we don’t really know. There’s no definitive answer since casinos are extremely secretive about their operations. However, there is some evidence that suggests dealers may do this intentionally. 

For example, one study found that blackjack dealers gave players roughly 50 percent more cards when they were betting larger sums of money. This gave the house a better chance of winning since it gave them more opportunities to bust. Another study found that dealers were more likely to give players cards when they had a lower chance of winning. 

So while there’s no definitive proof that dealers push players towards games where the odds are against them, there is evidence that suggests this may be happening. If you want to minimize your chances of being taken advantage of by a casino dealer, then always stick to blackjack and craps – these games have a lower house edge than other games.

#  How to Spot Whether Your Casino Dealer is Pushing the Limits

The life of a casino dealer is a risky one. It’s not just the possibility of losing money while dealing, but also the ever-present risk of being caught cheating by casino management.

So, how can you tell if your casino dealer is pushing the limits? Here are four tips:

1) Watch how they handle the cards

If your dealer is dealing from the bottom of the deck, or mixing up the order of the cards, then it’s likely that they’re trying to cheat. Similarly, look out for dealers who are “cutting” the cards – this is where they split the pack in two and interleave them in such a way that it becomes difficult for other players to follow the sequence.

2) Look out for dealers who are betting aggressively

If your dealer is constantly wagering large sums of money, it could be a sign that they’re trying to make some extra money on the side. Remember, if your dealer is betting heavily, they’re less likely to be paying attention to their cards – something which could work in your favour.

3) Check for signs of collusion with other players

If you notice that your dealer seems to be working particularly closely with another player at the table, it could be a sign that they’re colluding in order to win more money. Keep an eye on their hands and their betting patterns – if they seem to be acting in tandem, there’s a good chance something fishy is going on.

4) Be aware of any suspicious behaviour

If you notice any behaviour that seems out of place – such as dealers fiddling with their chips or adjusting their glasses – then it could be a sign that they’re trying to hide something. Trust your instincts and if something doesn’t feel right, speak up!
