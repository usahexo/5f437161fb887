#  What is Boomanji?

Boomanji is a popular casino game that can be played at land-based and online casinos. The game is a variation of the classic poker game and is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. In Boomanji, players are dealt two cards face down, and four cards are placed face up in the middle of the table. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of your two cards and the four face-up cards.

# How to Play

To begin play, each player must place an Ante bet. The four face-up cards are then turned over and players have the option to either Fold or Call. If a player folds, they forfeit their Ante bet and their hand is complete. If a player calls, they must place another bet equal to their Ante bet. The dealer then flips over one more card, which becomes the final card in the player’s hand. The best five-card hand using any combination of the two cards and the five board cards wins the pot.

# Winning Hands

There are a number of different winning hands in Boomanji, with different payouts depending on the casino you are playing at. The most common winning hands are as follows: Royal Flush - 100:1 Straight Flush - 50:1 Four of a Kind - 25:1 Full House - 9:1 Flush - 6:1 Straight - 4:1 Three of a Kind - 3:1 Two Pair - 2:1 Pair of Jacks or Better - 1:1

The jackpots in Boomanji are one of the primary reasons why the game is so popular. There are three different jackpots that players can aim for, and each of them has its own unique set of prizes.

The Mini Jackpot is worth just a few thousand dollars, but it’s still a great prize for players who manage to win it. The Major Jackpot is worth much more, with a prize pool that often exceeds $100,000. Finally, there’s the Mega Jackpot, which is always worth well over $250,000.

For players who want to aim high, the Mega Jackpot is definitely the prize to shoot for. It’s not always easy to win, but the potential payout is definitely worth the effort.
