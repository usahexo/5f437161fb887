        <h1 id="Nevada-Gaming-Control-Board-Recommends-10-Slot-Machine-Games-To-Play-For-Actual-Money"><a href="#Nevada-Gaming-Control-Board-Recommends-10-Slot-Machine-Games-To-Play-For-Actual-Money" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Gaming Control Board Recommends 10 Slot Machine Games To Play For Actual Money"></a>Nevada Gaming Control Board Recommends 10 Slot Machine Games To Play For Actual Money</h1><p>In May of 2018, the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) made its recommendations for the top 10 slot machine games to play for money in the state. In order to compile this list, the NGCB analyzed data on game popularity and payouts from all of Nevada’s casinos.</p>
<p>The first slot machine game on the list is Cleopatra by IGT. This Egyptian-themed game has proven to be a popular choice among casino players, with its frequent payouts and exciting bonus rounds.</p>
<p>Another IGT game that made the list is Wheel of Fortune Triple Extreme Spin. This slot machine is based on the popular TV show and offers players three different spinning wheels for even more chances to win big.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top three is another game by IGT – Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Based on the hit movie, this slot machine features exciting gameplay and stunning graphics that will keep players coming back for more.</p>
<p>Other games on the list include Quick Hit Platinum by Bally Technologies, Sumo Spins by Konami Gaming, Golden Goddess by High 5 Games, and many others. So if you’re looking for some excitement while playing slots, be sure to check out one of these games at your local casino.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Rich-Quick-Slot-Machine-Payouts-In-Atlantic-City-Highest-In-Country"><a href="#Get-Rich-Quick-Slot-Machine-Payouts-In-Atlantic-City-Highest-In-Country" class="headerlink" title="Get Rich Quick: Slot Machine Payouts In Atlantic City Highest In Country"></a>Get Rich Quick: Slot Machine Payouts In Atlantic City Highest In Country</h1><p>Atlantic City is known for its casinos and gambling, but a recent study shows that the payouts at the slot machines in Atlantic City are the highest in the country.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the personal finance website SmartAsset, looked at data from all of the casinos in Atlantic City as well as from around the country. The findings showed that the average payout at a slot machine in Atlantic City was 94.77 percent, which was higher than any other casino market in the country.</p>
<p>The next closest market was Reno, Nevada, where the average payout was just 89.07 percent. In Las Vegas, the average payout was only 85.48 percent.</p>
<p>What accounts for this difference? It’s likely due to a combination of factors including tighter regulations in other states as well as competition among casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, if you’re looking to hit it big at a casino, Atlantic City is certainly your best bet. Just keep in mind that you have a better chance of losing money than winning it – so gamble responsibly!</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Online-Slot-Machines-Pay-Out-More-Than-Other-Gambling-Games"><a href="#Study-Shows-Online-Slot-Machines-Pay-Out-More-Than-Other-Gambling-Games" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Online Slot Machines Pay Out More Than Other Gambling Games"></a>Study Shows Online Slot Machines Pay Out More Than Other Gambling Games</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Slot machines are the most popular gambling game in the world and they offer some of the best chances of winning big payouts. Online slot machines, in particular, have been shown to payout more frequently than other casino games.</p>
<p>A recent study by the UK Gambling Commission found that online slots payout 92% of the time, while other casino games only payout 85% of the time. This means that players are more likely to win a payout playing online slots than playing any other casino game.</p>
<p>This is great news for players who enjoy gambling on slot machines, as it increases their chances of winning big payouts. Online casinos offer a wide variety of slot machines, so players can find the perfect game for them. With such high payout rates, players can look forward to winning some exciting payouts while enjoying a fun and exciting casino game.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Awarded-5th-License-For-Online-Slot-Machine-Gaming"><a href="#Delaware-Awarded-5th-License-For-Online-Slot-Machine-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Awarded 5th License For Online Slot Machine Gaming"></a>Delaware Awarded 5th License For Online Slot Machine Gaming</h1><p>The state of Delaware has been awarded a fifth license for online slot machine gaming, by the United States Supreme Court. The state already offers online table games and poker to its residents, and this new license will allow it to offer slots as well. Delaware expects that this new addition to its online gaming suite will bring in an additional $7 million in revenue per year.</p>
<p>The current operators of the state’s online gambling products are Delaware Park, Dover Downs, and Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino. These three casinos will be responsible for offering the slots games to players in the state. They have not yet announced any specific plans for what games they will offer or when the service will go live.</p>
<p>Delaware is one of just a handful of states that offer online casino gaming to its residents. The others are Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. This new license gives Delaware a slight edge over those states, as it now has five licenses instead of four.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is expected to soon award its sixth and final license for online slots gaming. That state is also expected to see an increase in revenue from online gambling once the license is awarded. It is currently unclear who will receive that license, but there are a number of interested parties including MGM Resorts International and Caesars Entertainment Corporation</p>
<h1 id="Borgata-Casino-Aims-To-Attract-New-Players-With-Free-Slot-Machine-Game"><a href="#Borgata-Casino-Aims-To-Attract-New-Players-With-Free-Slot-Machine-Game" class="headerlink" title="Borgata Casino Aims To Attract New Players With Free Slot Machine Game"></a>Borgata Casino Aims To Attract New Players With Free Slot Machine Game</h1><p>The Borgata Casino is looking to attract new players by giving them a free slot machine game. The game, called NJ’s Free Slot Machine, is currently available on the casino’s website.</p>
<p>The casino is hoping that the game will get more people playing its online slots. It also hopes that the game will keep players engaged with the casino and encourage them to come back for more.</p>
<p>NJ’s Free Slot Machine offers players a chance to win free spins on some of the casino’s most popular slot machines. These include games such as Wu Long, Knights Quest, and Rook’s Revenge.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the free spins, players must first register for an account with the casino. They can then start playing the game by clicking on the “Play Now” button.</p>
<p>The casino has also announced that it will be giving away prizes worth $10,000 over the next few weeks. These include cash prizes, bonus chips, and free spins.</p>
<p>Players can enter the prize draw by playing any of the casino’s online slots. They will then automatically earn one entry into the draw for every $10 they wager on these games.</p>

        <h1 id="Brigitte-Bardot-Finally-Comes-to-America"><a href="#Brigitte-Bardot-Finally-Comes-to-America" class="headerlink" title="Brigitte Bardot Finally Comes to America!"></a>Brigitte Bardot Finally Comes to America!</h1><p>After years of being a film and fashion icon in France, Brigitte Bardot finally comes to America! She is already a major star in Europe, but with the release of her first American film, “And God Created Woman”, she becomes an international sensation.</p>
<p>Bardot’s bombshell looks and uninhibited sex appeal make her the toast of Hollywood. She quickly becomes one of the biggest stars in the world, and is mobbed by fans wherever she goes.</p>
<p>Despite her success, Brigitte is unhappy in America. The lifestyle is too hectic for her, and she misses her family and friends in France. In 1958, she announces her retirement from acting and returns to France.</p>
<p>Brigitte Bardot remains an iconic figure to this day. She has been credited with popularizing the bikini, and is considered one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the screen. Her influence on fashion and cinema cannot be overstated, and she remains one of the most beloved movie stars of all time.</p>
<h1 id="Old-School-Favorite-Doritos-Roulette-Seeing-a-Huge-Revival-Thanks-to-BB"><a href="#Old-School-Favorite-Doritos-Roulette-Seeing-a-Huge-Revival-Thanks-to-BB" class="headerlink" title="Old School Favorite Doritos Roulette Seeing a Huge Revival Thanks to BB"></a>Old School Favorite Doritos Roulette Seeing a Huge Revival Thanks to BB</h1><p>In recent years, Doritos Roulette has seen a resurgence in popularity. This old-school favorite is suddenly back in favor, and sales are through the roof. Thanks to BB, everyone can now enjoy this classic snack.</p>
<p>What is Doritos Roulette? It’s a simple recipe: take your favorite Doritos chip, and add one that’s extra spicy. The result is a snack that’s both delicious and dangerous. The spicier chip hidden inside provides a real jolt of heat, catching unsuspecting taste buds off guard.</p>
<p>Why is Doritos Roulette experiencing a revival? There are a few possible explanations. First, the advent of social media has made it easier for people to share their experiences with spicy foods. With platforms like YouTube and Instagram, people can easily show off their latest culinary conquests. And what could be more impressive than conquering a bag of Doritos Roulette?</p>
<p>Second, the current trend toward spicy foods has helped to boost the popularity of this snack. In recent years, Americans have become increasingly interested in spicy flavors. Restaurants like Chipotle and Blaze Pizza have built their businesses around dishes that pack a punch of heat. And now consumers are looking for similar flavors in their snacks and appetizers.</p>
<p>Finally, BB may have something to do with the resurgence of Doritos Roulette. The company has been credited with helping to revive several classic snacks, including Cheetos and Combos. By bringing these snacks back into the mainstream, BB has shown that there’s still demand for them among consumers. And with its wide distribution network, the company can bring these snacks to stores nationwide.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for an old-school snack with a new-school twist, give Doritos Roulette a try. Thanks to BB, it’s easier than ever to find this classic snack at your local store.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Knew-BB-Loved-Doritos-Roulette-So-Much"><a href="#Who-Knew-BB-Loved-Doritos-Roulette-So-Much" class="headerlink" title="Who Knew BB Loved Doritos Roulette So Much?!"></a>Who Knew BB Loved Doritos Roulette So Much?!</h1><p>BB, the family dog, always loved Doritos. But nobody knew how much until he got his paws on a bag of Roulette.</p>
<p>Turns out, BB is a bit of a daredevil when it comes to his Doritos. He loves the thrill of risking it all for a chance at that extra spicy kick.</p>
<p>Some days, he’ll just eat the regular chip flavor without any problem. But then there are those occasions when he has to go for the Roulette chips — even if it means dealing with the heat.</p>
<p>Even we humans can’t help but be impressed by BB’s intestinal fortitude. He never shies away from a challenge, and always goes for the gusto.</p>
<p>We think that attitude is pretty admirable, and it’s definitely something we can all learn from. So next time you’re feeling risky, don’t be afraid to try something new (like Roulette Doritos, obviously!).</p>
<h1 id="Did-Brigitte-Bardot-Just-Admit-She’s-a-Secret-Roulette-Lover"><a href="#Did-Brigitte-Bardot-Just-Admit-She’s-a-Secret-Roulette-Lover" class="headerlink" title="Did Brigitte Bardot Just Admit She’s a Secret Roulette Lover?!"></a>Did Brigitte Bardot Just Admit She’s a Secret Roulette Lover?!</h1><p>In a new interview, Brigitte Bardot has admitted that she used to love playing roulette - but she’s never revealed whether or not she’s still a fan of the game!</p>
<p>Bardot, who is now 83 years old, was asked about her gambling past in light of France’s new online gambling legislation. She didn’t hold back, admitting that she used to frequent casinos in Monaco and play roulette - and sometimes, she’d even bet on black!</p>
<p>“Yes, I loved playing roulette,” Bardot said. “But I was never very lucky!”</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether or not Bardot still enjoys playing roulette, but her comments have definitely intrigued fans and gamblers alike. With online gambling now being legal in France, it’ll be interesting to see if Bardot takes up the game again - or if she’s been put off by recent casino closures in the country.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, we’re sure Bardot will continue to surprise us with her candid comments!</p>
<h1 id="Could-Brigitte-Bardot-Be-the-Reason-Doritos-Roulette-is-So-Popular-Again"><a href="#Could-Brigitte-Bardot-Be-the-Reason-Doritos-Roulette-is-So-Popular-Again" class="headerlink" title="Could Brigitte Bardot Be the Reason Doritos Roulette is So Popular Again?"></a>Could Brigitte Bardot Be the Reason Doritos Roulette is So Popular Again?</h1><p>Doritos Roulette is one of the most popular snacks in the world. It has been around since the early 1990s, but it has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years. One theory for this is that Brigitte Bardot’s endorsement of the snack in a 2017 interview helped to boost its profile.</p>
<p>Bardot is a French actress and model who was popular in the 1950s and 60s. She is considered to be a sex symbol, and she has appeared on covers of magazines such as Playboy and Elle. In 2017, she gave an interview with Paris Match in which she praised Doritos Roulette.</p>
<p>She said that the snack was “very tasty” and that it was her favorite food. She also said that it was important for people to eat spicy foods because they contain antioxidants. Bardot’s endorsement may have helped to popularize Doritos Roulette among young people in France.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear whether her endorsement had a significant impact on the snack’s popularity worldwide. Doritos Roulette has been popular in the United States for many years, and there is no evidence that Bardot’s endorsement caused a surge in sales there.</p>

However, not all hands are created equal. Some hands are much stronger than others and should be played more often.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the five best poker hands to play in poker:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of the ace, king, queen, jack, and ten of the same suit. This hand is very rare and should be played as often as possible.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Straight Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A straight flush is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit. This hand is also very rare and should be played whenever possible.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Four of a Kind</li>
</ol>
<p>A four of a kind is a hand that consists of four cards of the same rank. This hand is quite strong and should usually be played heads-up or against two other opponents.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Full House</li>
</ol>
<p>A full house is a hand that consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand is usually quite strong and can be played in many different situations.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Flush</li>
</ol>
<p>A flush is a hand that consists of five cards of the same suit, but not in consecutive order. This hand can be quite strong, but should generally only be played against one other opponent.</p>
<h1 id="3-High-Powered-Poker-Hands-to-Play-Now"><a href="#3-High-Powered-Poker-Hands-to-Play-Now" class="headerlink" title="3 High-Powered Poker Hands to Play Now"></a>3 High-Powered Poker Hands to Play Now</h1><p>In poker, there are countless possibilities for hands that you can play. However, not all hands are created equal. Here are three high-powered hands that you should be playing now:</p>
<h3 id="Aces-Full-of-Kings"><a href="#Aces-Full-of-Kings" class="headerlink" title="Aces Full of Kings"></a>Aces Full of Kings</h3><p>This hand is a powerhouse. You have a pair of aces and a king, giving you four of a kind. This hand is strong enough to take on any other hand in the game.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when playing this hand. Firstly, make sure that you raise enough preflop so that you get all of the money in on the flop. Secondly, bet big on the flop and turn to scare your opponents out of the pot. Finally, always be aware of the possibility of getting counterfeited – if an opponent has two kings, they could very well beat your four of a kind.</p>
<h3 id="Straight-Flush"><a href="#Straight-Flush" class="headerlink" title="Straight Flush"></a>Straight Flush</h3><p>A straight flush is one of the strongest possible hands in poker. This hand consists of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. There are only four suits, so there are only 16 possible straights flushes.</p>
<p>When playing this hand, make sure to play it cautiously – there is always the chance that an opponent could have a higher straight or flush. However, if you do hit your straight flush, be prepared to take down the pot!</p>
<h3 id="Royal-Flush"><a href="#Royal-Flush" class="headerlink" title="Royal Flush"></a>Royal Flush</h3><p>A royal flush is the strongest possible hand in poker. This hand consists of 10 consecutive cards all of the same suit. There are only four suits, so there are only 1,320 possible royal flushes.</p>
<p>When playing this hand, make sure to play it cautiously – there is always the chance that an opponent could have a higher straight or flush. However, if you do hit your royal flush, be prepared to take down the pot!</p>

<p>3-of-a Kind<br>This hand consists of three cards of the same rank. It is a strong hand, but not as strong as a full house or a straight flush. </p>
<p>2 Pair<br>This hand consists of two different pairs of cards. It is a strong hand, but not as strong as a full house or four of a kind. </p>
<p>1 Pair<br>This hand consists of two matching cards. It is not a very strong hand, but it can still win some pots. </p>

In this article, we’ll take a look at the five best hands for beginners.</p>
<p>#1: Aces</p>
<p>Aces are the best hand in poker, and they should always be played if you have them. Aces can be used in any situation, whether you’re trying to win the pot or just stay in the game.</p>
<p>#2: Kings</p>
<p>Kings are a very strong hand, second only to aces. If you have kings, be sure to bet big and try to win the pot.</p>
<p>#3: Queens</p>
<p>Queens are one of the strongest middle-ranking hands, and they should be played whenever you have the opportunity. Just make sure you don’t risk too much money with queens in case someone else has a better hand.</p>
<p>#4: Jacks</p>
<p>Jacks are a good hand to play if you’re trying to stay in the game but don’t want to risk too much money. They aren’t as strong as queens or kings, but they can still help you win some pots.</p>
<p>#5: Tens or Better</p>
<p>Tens or better is a basic starting hand in poker, and it’s essential that you learn how to play it well. With tens or better, you want to aim to get as many cards as possible so that you can make a winning combination.</p>

        <h1 id="Why-Do-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#Why-Do-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="Why Do People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot?"></a>Why Do People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot?</h1><p>In almost all variants of baccarat, the value of a hand is its point total. Bets are placed on the player, banker, or tie hands. The aim of the game is to guess which one of these will have a point total as close as possible to 9.</p>
<p>In French, “rien” means “nothing”. And so, while in English we might say “zero”, in baccarat, the players say “rien” to bet on a hand with no points at all.</p>
<p>Brigitte Bardot was a famous actress and sex symbol during the 1950s and 1960s. She starred in many movies, including Bicycle Thieves (1948) and And God Created Woman (1956). During her career, she was also known for her scandalous personal life. She once said, “I am not ashamed to say that I am a feminist. But I’m not a man-hater.”</p>
<p>So why do people say “nothin” in baccarat instead of “zero”? The answer lies in Brigitte Bardot’s feminism. In French, “rien” means both “nothing” and “no one”. So when players say “rien” in baccarat, they’re not only betting on a hand with no points, they’re also betting against the other players.</p>
<h1 id="The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot"></a>The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot</h1><p>When players make a bet at the Baccarat table, they are given the option to wager on one of three possible outcomes: Player, Banker, or Tie. Each bet has a different payout odds attached to it. In order to make things simple for players, all of the chips that are wagered will be placed in the middle of the table and divided equally between the Player and Banker bets—this is known as a “street” or “spread” bet.</p>
<p>The game progresses when one of two things happen: either a Player or Banker hand is drawn, or the cards in play reach a total value of 8 or 9 (a natural). If a Player or Banker hand is drawn, then their respective totals are compared and the winner is paid out according to the payout odds attached to their bet. If a natural occurs, then no further drawing takes place and both hands are automatically winners; the payout odds are simply multiplied by two in this instance.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to break down some baccarat lingo, you might hear people refer to a “zero” as “Nothin In Baccarat.” This term comes from when someone places a bet on Banker and the banker hand results in a zero value (either through two identical cards being dealt or by picking up a 0 card). In this instance, the player would lose their banked chip even though no other player hand was involved in the game. To avoid any confusion, simply remember that when someone says “Nothin In Baccarat,” they’re referring to when their chosen bet lost due to an occurrence of zero.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#What’s-The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="What’s The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot?"></a>What’s The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot?</h1><p>In the game of Baccarat, some players say “nothin” in place of zero. Why do they do this?</p>
<p>There are a few different explanations for why people say “nothin” instead of zero in Baccarat. One explanation is that “nothin” is easier to say than “zero”. Another explanation is that the pronunciation of “zero” sounds like the word “sour”, and so players want to avoid saying it.</p>
<p>A third explanation is that the term “nothin” comes from an old French gambling game called Chemin de Fer. In this game, there was a special card called a “null”. The null was worth nothing, and so players would say “nothin” when they were referring to this card.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, the term “nothin” is now commonly used in Baccarat to refer to the number zero.</p>
<h1 id="A-Look-At-The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#A-Look-At-The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="A Look At The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot"></a>A Look At The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot</h1><p>There are many different versions of baccarat, but the most common one is the Punto Banco version. The game is played with 6 or 8 decks of cards, and the purpose is to get as close as possible to 9. The number 0 doesn’t exist in baccarat, and that’s why some people say “nothin” instead of “zero”.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand about baccarat is that there are three different betting options: player, banker, and tie. The player and banker bets are simply wagers on who will win the hand. The tie bet is a wager on whether or not the hand will end in a draw. If both the player and banker have the same score, it’s called a tie and the player wins half of their bet back.</p>
<p>In order to win a hand of baccarat, your final score needs to be either closer to 9 than your opponent’s score, or equal to their score. If your final score is 9, it’s called a natural and you automatically win. If your final score is 0 (or “nothin”), you lose your bet.</p>
<p>One thing you should keep in mind when playing baccarat is that the house edge is very low. In fact, it’s only around 1.06% for the player bet and around 1.24% for the banker bet. This means that you have a decent chance of winning your bet, which is why some people prefer this game over other casino games like blackjack or roulette.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-About-The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot"><a href="#Learn-About-The-Reason-Why-People-Say-Nothin-In-Baccarat-Instead-Of-Zero-Brigitte-Bardot" class="headerlink" title="Learn About The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot"></a>Learn About The Reason Why People Say Nothin In Baccarat Instead Of Zero Brigitte Bardot</h1><p>There is a reason why people say “nothin” in baccarat instead of zero. Brigitte Bardot is the answer. The French actress was considered one of the most beautiful women in the world during her heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. She was often photographed wearing revealing clothing, which led to her being dubbed “sex kitten.” Her film career began in 1952 with a small role in Jean-Louis Trintignant’s drama Les Amants. She achieved international fame the following year with her performance opposite Marcello Mastroianni in Roger Vadim’s controversial drama And God Created Woman.</p>
<p>Bardot went on to star in a number of other successful films, including Sacha Guitry’s comedy Pot-Bouille (1957) and Louis Malle’s romantic drama Viva Maria! (1965). However, she announced her retirement from acting at the age of 36, after appearing in what would be her last feature film, Esclavage moderne (1975). From then on, she focused on animal rights activism and became a noted international spokeswoman for the protection of animals.</p>
<p> So why is Brigitte Bardot associated with baccarat? In 1966, she starred in Vie Privée, a French film directed by Louis Malle. The movie features a baccarat scene in which Bardot’s character loses over 10 million francs. Because of this infamous scene, Vie Privée is sometimes referred to as “the baccarat movie.” Baccarat subsequently gained immense popularity in France as a result of Vie Privée’s widespread publicity. And since “nothin” sounds more like “nothin” than “zero,” that’s how baccarat players came to say “nothin” instead of “zero.”</p>

<p>Bermuda shorts are a summer staple for both men and women. They come in many different styles and colors, making it easy to find the perfect pair for your body type and personality. However, with so many options available it can be difficult to know where to start.</p>
<p>The first step is to decide what style of Bermuda shorts is right for you. There are three main styles: classic, tailored, and relaxed. Classic Bermudas are fitted and have a straight leg. Tailored Bermudas are also fitted but have a slight taper at the ankle. Relaxed Bermudas are loose-fitting with a wide leg.</p>
<p>Once you’ve decided on the style of Bermuda shorts that you want, you need to determine your waist size. This can be done by measuring around your waistline with a tape measure or by using online size guides. Once you have your waist size, you can begin shopping for Bermudas that fit your measurements.</p>
<p>It’s important to try on different pairs of Bermudas before purchasing them to make sure they fit well. Be sure to check the inseam length as well as the waist and hip measurements. The inseam should be just long enough to cover your knees when they are bent, and the waist and hip measurements should be comfortable without being too tight or too loose.</p>

<p>When choosing a blackjack Bermuda, there are a few things you’ll want to keep in mind. First, be sure to pick a variety that is suited to your climate and growing conditions. Secondly, make sure you select a cultivar that is well-adapted to your specific region. Finally, take into account the size of your garden and choose a variety that will fit comfortably.</p>
<p>The best blackjacks for gardens:</p>
<p>There are several excellent cultivars of blackjack Bermuda that are well-suited for garden use. ‘Patriot’ is an excellent choice for those in cooler climates, while ‘Tifway 419’ is more tolerant of heat and humidity. For smaller gardens, ‘Barbados’ or ‘Collegiate Green’ may be better choices, whereas those with larger spaces may prefer the more vigorous ‘Classic’.</p>
<p>Planting and care:</p>
<p>Once you’ve selected the right blackjack Bermuda for your needs, it’s time to plant it! Be sure to follow the instructions on the seed packet, as spacing and planting depth can vary depending on the variety. In most cases, it’s best to sow seeds in early spring after the danger of frost has passed. Water regularly until plants are established, then water only when necessary. You should also mow regularly (at least once per week) to keep the grass healthy and looking its best.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="When-seemed-to-be-gambling-banned-in-Habbo-Resort"><a href="#When-seemed-to-be-gambling-banned-in-Habbo-Resort" class="headerlink" title="When seemed to be gambling banned in Habbo Resort?"></a>When seemed to be gambling banned in Habbo Resort?</h1><p>Earlier this year, Habbo Resort introduced a new policy that bans gambling and the use of virtual property for financial gain. This change caused quite a stir in the community, with many players wondering why this new rule was put in place.</p>
<p>Some people speculated that the ban had to do with recent crackdowns on gambling by the UK Gambling Commission. Others thought that it was simply an attempt by Habbo Resort to clean up the game and make it more family-friendly.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasoning behind it, the new policy has definitely made gambling much harder on Habbo Resort. Previously, there were numerous ways to gamble on the site, from casino games to SBCs (special betting contracts). Now, however, all of those avenues have been closed off.</p>
<p>This has left many players frustrated, as gambling was a major part of the Habbo Resort experience. Some have even gone so far as to call for a boycott of the game until the policy is reversed.</p>
<p>Whether or not this will actually happen remains to be seen. In the meantime, though, it looks like gambling is going to be much harder on Habbo Resort than it used to be.</p>
<h1 id="What-caused-the-seeming-gambling-ban-in-Habbo-Resort"><a href="#What-caused-the-seeming-gambling-ban-in-Habbo-Resort" class="headerlink" title="What caused the seeming gambling ban in Habbo Resort?"></a>What caused the seeming gambling ban in Habbo Resort?</h1><p>In early 2017, Habbo Resort, a popular social media platform for teenagers, made headlines when it was announced that the site would be implementing a gambling ban. This caused much confusion among users of the platform, who were unsure of what this change would mean for their experience on the site.</p>
<p>In order to understand why Habbo Resort enacted this ban and what implications it has for its users, we must first take a look at what gambling is and how it is used on the platform. Gambling is typically defined as the risk of losing something of value in order to gain something else of value. In the context of online gaming platforms like Habbo Resort, this can take many different forms. One popular example of gambling in online gaming is betting on virtual items or currencies. Players will bet on items or currencies that they believe will rise in value relative to other items or currencies available on the platform.</p>
<p>So why did Habbo Resort decide to implement a gambling ban? It is likely that the site decided to do so in order to protect its users from potential harm. Gambling can be addictive and can lead players to spend more money than they intended on the platform. This can result in financial hardship for players and their families. In addition, gambling may also lead to player frustration and anger when bets are lost. This can create an environment where players are less likely to behave positively on the site.</p>
<p>The impact of Habbo Resort’s gambling ban remains to be seen. Some users have complained that the change has made the site less fun or engaging. It is possible that this could be true for some users; however, it is also possible that those who gamble excessively will no longer spend as much time or money on the platform. Only time will tell how this change impacts Habbo Resort’s user base as a whole</p>
<h1 id="Are-players-concerned-about-the-apparent-gambling-ban-in-Habbo-Resort"><a href="#Are-players-concerned-about-the-apparent-gambling-ban-in-Habbo-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Are players concerned about the apparent gambling ban in Habbo Resort?"></a>Are players concerned about the apparent gambling ban in Habbo Resort?</h1><p>$</p>
<p>There has been a lot of talk recently about a possible gambling ban being implemented in Habbo Resort, with some players concerned that this could have an impact on their experience within the game.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>Habbo Resort is a social media platform where users can explore different resorts, meet new friends, and participate in various activities. One of the main attractions of the game is its casino, which allows players to gamble their coins on games such as blackjack, roulette, and slots.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>The possibility of a gambling ban being introduced has sparked concern among some players who worry that they may no longer be able to enjoy the casino games. However, it is important to note that no official announcement has been made regarding such a ban, so it is still unclear whether or not it will actually be implemented.</p>
<p>$</p>
<p>In the meantime, players can continue to enjoy the casino games as usual and should keep an eye out for any updates on the situation. Whether or not a gambling ban is eventually introduced, Habbo Resort is sure to continue to be a popular online destination for socializing and gaming.</p>
<h1 id="What-will-happen-to-those-caught-gambling-in-Habbo-Resort"><a href="#What-will-happen-to-those-caught-gambling-in-Habbo-Resort" class="headerlink" title="What will happen to those caught gambling in Habbo Resort?"></a>What will happen to those caught gambling in Habbo Resort?</h1><p>For years, Habbo Resort has been a hotspot for gambling. Whether it be casino games, lotteries or betting on races, there’s something for everyone who wants to take a chance. However, with new regulations in place that restrict online gambling, what will happen to those caught gaming in Habbo Resort?</p>
<p>It’s likely that the resort will take a hard line against those caught gambling. In the past, resorts have banned players from their premises and even cancelled their accounts. It’s possible that Habbo Resort could implement a similar policy, which would mean that anyone caught gambling would be prevented from accessing the resort’s games and services.</p>
<p>This would be a huge blow to the resort’s gaming community, many of whom enjoy taking risks in the hope of winning big. Without access to the resort’s games and services, these players would have to look elsewhere for their thrills. This could lead to an increase in illegal gambling activities, as players look for ways to get around the restrictions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be up to Habbo Resort to decide how it wants to deal with those caught gambling. If the resort wants to discourage gambling among its players, then it may opt for a strict policy that bans offenders from its premises. However, if it wants to keep its gaming community healthy and happy, then it may choose to take a more lenient approach.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-gambling-ban-really-necessary-in-Habbo-Resort"><a href="#Is-the-gambling-ban-really-necessary-in-Habbo-Resort" class="headerlink" title="Is the gambling ban really necessary in Habbo Resort?"></a>Is the gambling ban really necessary in Habbo Resort?</h1><p>Gambling has been a huge part of Habbo Resort since its inception and the recent removal of the ability to gamble in game has left many players feeling upset. Some believe that the gambling ban is necessary in order to protect those who may be susceptible to addiction, while others feel that it takes away from one of the core elements of the game.</p>
<p>The main concern with gambling in Habbo Resort is that it can be addictive and lead players down a path of financial ruin. There have been cases where people have lost large sums of money as a result of gambling and this can be extremely harmful for those who are struggling financially. While there is no doubt that gambling can be dangerous, there is also a risk that the ban will simply drive those who want to gamble underground. This could lead to an increase in illegal gambling activity and make it harder for authorities to track down those responsible.</p>
<p>Another concern with the gambling ban is that it could damage the economy of Habbo Resort. The casino was a major source of revenue for hotels and removing it could lead to financial hardship for many players. It is also possible that the ban could lead to a decrease in player numbers, as people move on to other games where they can gamble without restriction.</p>
<p>Overall, there are pros and cons to both sides of the argument around the gambling ban in Habbo Resort. Those who argue in favour of the ban say that it is necessary to protect vulnerable players, while those against it argue that it takes away from one of the key elements of the game. Ultimately, it is up to each individual player to decide whether they think the gambling ban is necessary or not.</p>

        <h1 id="Casino-Dealers-Could-Strike-Over-Proposed-New-Gambling-Rules"><a href="#Casino-Dealers-Could-Strike-Over-Proposed-New-Gambling-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Casino Dealers Could Strike Over Proposed New Gambling Rules"></a>Casino Dealers Could Strike Over Proposed New Gambling Rules</h1><p>Casino dealers in the US are threatening to go on strike if a proposed new set of rules gets approved.</p>
<p>The new rules, which have been drawn up by the state of Illinois, would see casino dealers forced to share their tips with other members of staff. This would include people like security guards and cleaners, who are not traditionally given tips by casino dealers.</p>
<p>The proposed rules have attracted a great deal of criticism from casino employees, who argue that it is unfair for them to be forced to share their tips with people who don’t usually receive them.</p>
<p>Dealers also argue that the new rules could lead to them receiving less money in tips overall. This is because customers may be less likely to leave a tip if they know that it will be shared amongst a number of people.</p>
<p>In response to the proposed rules, casino dealers across Illinois have started talks about going on strike. A spokesman for the dealers said: “We are not currently striking, but we are talking about it. We believe this is a very serious issue and we are not going to stand for it.”</p>
<p>The spokesman added that the dealers are planning to hold a vote on whether or not to go on strike in the near future. If they do decide to strike, it is unclear how long the action will last for.</p>
<p>The proposed new rules come at a time when US casinos are facing increasing competition from overseas operators. In order to compete, casinos in Illinois need to find ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Introducing rules that force dealers to share their tips with other members of staff may be one way of achieving this.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Workers-Union-Says-Proposed-New-Gambling-Rules-Are-Unworkable"><a href="#Casino-Workers-Union-Says-Proposed-New-Gambling-Rules-Are-Unworkable" class="headerlink" title="Casino Workers Union Says Proposed New Gambling Rules Are Unworkable"></a>Casino Workers Union Says Proposed New Gambling Rules Are Unworkable</h1><p>The proposed new gambling rules have been labelled as unworkable by the casino workers union. The new rules, which were proposed by the government, would see a reduction in the number of casinos in the country and would also see a change in the way that casino workers are employed.</p>
<p>The casino workers union has said that the proposed changes are not feasible and would lead to job losses and a reduction in the number of casinos in the country. They have also said that the government has not consulted with them about these changes and that they were only made aware of them through the media.</p>
<p>The casino workers union has said that it is willing to negotiate with the government about these proposed changes, but that they first need more information about what is being proposed. They have asked for a meeting with the government so that they can discuss these proposals further.</p>
<p>The government has said that it is still consulting with various stakeholders about these proposed changes and that no final decisions have been made yet. It is expected that a decision will be made in the next few months about whether or not these changes will be implemented.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Kickstarter-a-Form-of-Gambling-the-View-from-the-Casino-Floor"><a href="#Is-Kickstarter-a-Form-of-Gambling-the-View-from-the-Casino-Floor" class="headerlink" title="Is Kickstarter a Form of Gambling? the View from the Casino Floor"></a>Is Kickstarter a Form of Gambling? the View from the Casino Floor</h1><p>Innovation is the lifeblood of the casino industry. Just when you think gaming has reached its peak, a new game or technology comes along to redefine how we play. Slot machines, for example, used to be mechanical devices, with reels that spun and stopping on winning combinations. Now they are computerized, with randomized outcomes and dozens of possible bonus rounds.</p>
<p>So it was only a matter of time before online casinos started appearing, and in 2004 the first one opened its virtual doors. A few years later, in 2009, Kickstarter burst onto the scene, and soon people were using it to fund all manner of creative projects.</p>
<p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be much similarity between casinos and Kickstarter. But on closer inspection, I believe there are some parallels that can be drawn. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p>
<p>One similarity is that both casinos and Kickstarter involve risk-taking. When you gamble in a casino, you are betting your money on the chance that you will win more than you lose. And when you back a project on Kickstarter, you are investing in something that may not succeed – after all, only about 44% of projects reach their funding goals.</p>
<p>Another similarity is that both casinos and Kickstarter can be addictive. For some people, gambling can become a compulsive behavior, and they can’t resist the urge to keep playing no matter how much money they lose. The same is true for people who get hooked on backing Kickstarter projects – they can’t help but keep contributing money even when there’s no guarantee they will see any return on their investment.</p>
<p>A third similarity is that both casinos and Kickstarter can be thrilling experiences. The excitement of gambling comes from the risk-reward dynamic: the chance to win big money for a small bet is an adrenaline rush like no other. And for backers of Kickstarter projects, the thrill comes from watching their chosen project come to life and knowing they helped make it happen.</p>
<p>Finally, both casinos and Kickstarter can be fun ways to spend time with friends and family. Gambling can be a social activity, especially when played in groups, and backers often enjoy talking about the projects they’ve funded and sharing pictures and updates as they progress.</p>
<p>So do casinos and Kickstarter have anything in common? I believe they do – mainly because both involve risk-taking, addiction potential, thrills, fun, and socializing. Whether or not this is a good thing is up for debate; what’s clear is that these similarities make it worth examining casino culture through the lens of Kickstarter trends.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Senate-Panel-Approves-Bill-to-Regulate-and-Tax-Crowdfunding-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Senate-Panel-Approves-Bill-to-Regulate-and-Tax-Crowdfunding-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Senate Panel Approves Bill to Regulate and Tax Crowdfunding Gambling"></a>Nevada Senate Panel Approves Bill to Regulate and Tax Crowdfunding Gambling</h1><p>CARSON CITY — A state Senate panel on Tuesday approved a measure that would regulate and tax gambling by nonprofits through crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The bill, SB471, now goes to the full Senate for consideration. It would establish a regulatory framework for nonprofit organizations to conduct raffles and lotteries online.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding gambling would be limited to nonprofit groups and their members, with each member allowed to contribute no more than $100 per year. The Nevada Gaming Control Board would set the amount of the tax, which could not exceed 10 percent of the gross revenue generated from the gambling.</p>
<p>Sen. Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, said the bill is needed to permit and regulate internet gambling by nonprofit organizations that already are conducting such games illegally. He said the measure also would generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents said there is no need for more gambling in Nevada and it could lead to more problems with addiction. </p>
<p>Nevada has always been a leader in gambling innovation and this bill is just another example of that. If passed, SB471 would allow nonprofit organizations to conduct raffles and lotteries online in a safe and regulated environment. This would include specifying what games are allowed, how much individuals can contribute per year, and most importantly – setting a tax rate on the gross revenue generated from these activities.<br>Allowing crowdfunding gambling will not only provide extra revenue for Nevada but it will also create jobs in the casino industry – an industry that is currently struggling due to the recession. Gambling is a social activity that has been around for centuries and I believe that SB471 will be a positive addition to our state’s gaming laws</p>
<h1 id="Dealers-at-Las-Vegas-Casinos-Say-They’re-Being-Treated-Like-Poker-Machines"><a href="#Dealers-at-Las-Vegas-Casinos-Say-They’re-Being-Treated-Like-Poker-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Dealers at Las Vegas Casinos Say They’re Being Treated Like Poker Machines"></a>Dealers at Las Vegas Casinos Say They’re Being Treated Like Poker Machines</h1><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>Dealers at the casinos in Las Vegas say they’re being treated like poker machines, with the same lack of respect from customers. Many dealers have taken to social media to vent about the way they’re being treated, and some are even considering quitting their jobs.</p>
<p>One dealer, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s really frustrating. We’re not here to be abused - we’re here to help people enjoy their time and hopefully win some money. But we’re constantly being yelled at and treated like we’re nothing. It’s really demoralizing.”</p>
<p>Another dealer, Leslie Steinberg, said that she was often ignored by customers when trying to help them: “They’ll just glare at me and act like I’m not even there. It’s really disrespectful.”</p>
<p>Dealers aren’t the only ones who feel this way - cocktail waitresses and other casino staff have also voiced their complaints about the way they’re being treated by customers. Some are even considering leaving their jobs because of it.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they are aware of the issue and are working on ways to improve customer relations. In the meantime, however, employees continue to feel undervalued and unappreciated</p>

        <h1 id="Why-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-is-important-for-your-success-in-casino"><a href="#Why-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-is-important-for-your-success-in-casino" class="headerlink" title="Why playing fallacy throughout statistics is important for your success in casino!"></a>Why playing fallacy throughout statistics is important for your success in casino!</h1><p>Most people think playing casino is all about luck and there is no strategy involved. They could not be more wrong! The truth is, there are many ways you can improve your chances of winning, and using statistical fallacies is one of them.</p>
<p>The reason why playing fallacy throughout statistics is important for your success in casino is because it helps you to make better decisions when placing bets. For example, you may be tempted to bet on a certain number in roulette because it has come up several times in a row. However, this is not a valid strategy, as the odds of any number coming up are the same regardless of how often it has appeared in the past.</p>
<p>Fallacies can also help you to identify patterns in games such as blackjack and poker. For example, if you notice that the dealer is constantly having a high card showing, you can adjust your betting strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>While learning about fallacies and using them in casino can take some time and effort, it is well worth it in the long run. So why not give it a try? You may be surprised at how successful you can be!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-identify-and-avoid-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-in-casino"><a href="#How-to-identify-and-avoid-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-in-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to identify and avoid playing fallacy throughout statistics in casino!"></a>How to identify and avoid playing fallacy throughout statistics in casino!</h1><p>Statistics is one of the most important tools that gamblers can use to increase their chances of winning in casino games. However, it is also one of the most commonly abused tools. Many gamblers make the mistake of relying on faulty statistics that give them false hope of winning. This can lead to frustration and financial losses. In this article, we will discuss how to identify and avoid playing fallacy throughout statistics in casino!</p>
<p>One common fallacy in statistics is the Gambler’s Fallacy. The Gambler’s Fallacy occurs when a gambler believes that a certain event is more likely to happen because it did not happen in the past. For example, a gambler may think that a black number is more likely to come up on the roulette wheel because the previous several spins resulted in red numbers. This is not actually the case – each number has an equal chance of being chosen regardless of what has happened in the past.</p>
<p>Another common fallacy is the Hot Hand Fallacy. The Hot Hand Fallacy occurs when a gambler believes that they are “on a roll” and that they are likely to win again soon. This often leads to overconfidence and subsequent financial losses. There is no scientific evidence to support the idea of a hot hand – in fact, studies have shown that gamblers who think they are on a hot hand are actually more likely to lose money in the long run!</p>
<p>It is important for gamblers to be aware of these and other fallacies in statistics so that they can avoid making costly mistakes. By being aware of these fallacies, you can make statistically sound decisions while gambling and increase your chances of winning!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-of-the-most-common-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-in-casino"><a href="#What-are-some-of-the-most-common-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-in-casino" class="headerlink" title="What are some of the most common playing fallacy throughout statistics in casino?"></a>What are some of the most common playing fallacy throughout statistics in casino?</h1><p>Almost all casino games are based on some form of probability. However, many players seem to think that they can overcome the odds by using logical fallacies specific to casino games. In this article, we will look at some of the most common playing fallacies in casino and why they don’t work.</p>
<p>The Gambler’s Fallacy</p>
<p>The gambler’s fallacy is the belief that a particular event is more likely to happen because it has not happened for a while. For example, many players believe that blackjack is more likely to come up because there have been a lot of red cards drawn recently. This fallacy often leads players to make bad bets since they are expecting an event that is actually very unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The Hot and Cold fallacy</p>
<p>The hot and cold fallacy is the belief that a particular event is more likely to happen because it has been happening a lot recently or because it has not happened for a while. This fallacy often leads players to make bad bets since they are expecting an event that is actually very unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The Martingale System</p>
<p>The Martingale system is probably one of the most famous betting systems in casino games. The system works by doubling your bet after every loss until you win. This system can seem like a surefire way to win money in the short-term, but it actually has a very high chance of losing money in the long-term. This is because you will eventually run out of money to bet if you keep losing, and you will also have to make increasingly large bets just to break even.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-use-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-to-your-advantage-in-casino"><a href="#How-to-use-playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-to-your-advantage-in-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to use playing fallacy throughout statistics to your advantage in casino!"></a>How to use playing fallacy throughout statistics to your advantage in casino!</h1><p>In statistics, there is something called the playing fallacy which is often used to one’s advantage while gambling in a casino. The basic idea behind this fallacy is that you can use probability to your advantage by keeping track of what has happened in the past and making predictions about the future. Essentially, you are trying to make educated guesses about what might happen next so that you can put yourself in a better position to win while gambling.</p>
<p>There are a few simple steps that you can take in order to make the most of the playing fallacy while gambling in a casino. Firstly, it is important to understand how probability works. Probability is all about calculating the chances of something happening, and it can be used to work out the odds of winning or losing a particular bet. Secondly, you need to be aware of which bets offer the best chances of winning. There are certain bets that are known as “positive expected value” bets, which means that they have a higher chance of winning than losing in the long run. Finally, it is important to keep track of past results so that you can make informed predictions about the future. By using these three steps, you can give yourself the best chance of making money while gambling in a casino!</p>
<h1 id="Playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-What-works-what-doesn’t"><a href="#Playing-fallacy-throughout-statistics-What-works-what-doesn’t" class="headerlink" title="Playing fallacy throughout statistics: What works, what doesn’t"></a>Playing fallacy throughout statistics: What works, what doesn’t</h1><p>There is a big misconception that people have about playing statistics, which is that they think it can be applied to everything in their lives. The problem with this line of thinking is that, while statistics can give you a general idea of what might happen in any given scenario, it can never account for all the variables involved in any specific situation. In other words, just because something works statistically speaking, doesn’t mean it will work in reality.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re looking to buy a new house. You might look at the average price of houses in your area and find that the median price is $200,000. This might lead you to believe that if you want to buy a house for less than this amount, you’re going to have a tough time finding anything decent. However, this isn’t always the case. There are plenty of houses in desirable neighborhoods that are available for less than the median price. The point is, averages don’t tell the whole story; they only give you a general idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>This same principle applies to many other aspects of life as well. For instance, just because more people graduate from college than drop out doesn’t mean that graduating from college is necessarily a good idea. In fact, there are plenty of successful people who never even finished high school. The bottom line is that statistics can never provide a definitive answer to any question; they can only give you an idea of what might happen under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? It means that you should be careful not to rely too heavily on statistics when making decisions about your life. Instead, you should use them as a tool to help you make better informed decisions, but always remember that they can never tell the whole story. There are simply too many variables involved in any given situation for statistics to account for them all.</p>

The biggest disappointment was their early exit from the NCAA Tournament. They were upset by No. 14 seed Penn in the first round.</p>
<p>It was clear that this team wasn’t ready to compete at the highest level. They lacked depth and talent, especially on the wings. Devonte’ Graham was their only player who could create his own shot.</p>
<p>The Jayhawks struggled against good teams all year long. They lost to Arizona State, Texas Tech, Oklahoma and West Virginia. They also had close losses to Baylor and Syracuse.</p>
<p>There are definitely some things that need to be fixed if this team wants to make a run in the NCAA Tournament next year. They need more scorers and they need to improve their defensive play.</p>
<p>One positive for the Jayhawks is that they should be able to return all of their core players next year. This includes Graham, Svi Mykhailiuk, Udoka Azubuike and Lagerald Vick. If they can add a few key players in the offseason, they could be a force to be reckoned with in 2019-20.</p>
<h1 id="A-Rough-Night-for-the-Jayhawks"><a href="#A-Rough-Night-for-the-Jayhawks" class="headerlink" title="A Rough Night for the Jayhawks"></a>A Rough Night for the Jayhawks</h1><p>The Jayhawks stumbled to a 96-58 home loss to No. 10 Texas Tech on Tuesday night. It was the worst home loss under head coach Bill Self and the second-worst loss in school history.</p>
<p>Kansas (15-5, 5-3 Big 12) was never in the game, as Texas Tech (19-2, 7-1) raced out to a 28-point halftime lead and cruised from there. The Red Raiders shot 59 percent from the field, including 66 percent in the first half.</p>
<p>“We embarrassed Kansas tonight,” Self said. “I don’t know how else to put it. They whipped us from start to finish in every phase of the game. We were bad offensively and defensively and we didn’t do anything well at all.”</p>
<p>Devin Booker led Kansas with 18 points while Perry Ellis added 15. But no other Jayhawk scored more than six points as Texas Tech completely dominated down low, outscoring Kansas 44-16 in the paint.</p>
<p>This was easily the worst performance of the season for Kansas, which now falls into a tie for third place in the Big 12 standings. The Jayhawks will look to rebound on Saturday when they travel to Oklahoma State.</p>
<h1 id="Kansas-Struggles-in-Second-Half"><a href="#Kansas-Struggles-in-Second-Half" class="headerlink" title="Kansas Struggles in Second Half"></a>Kansas Struggles in Second Half</h1><p>In their second game of the season, the Kansas Jayhawks found themselves in a battle with the Indiana Hoosiers. Trailing by as many as 14 in the second half, the Jayhawks made a furious comeback but fell just short, losing 92-87.</p>
<p>Freshman Devon Dotson led the way for Kansas, scoring a team-high 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Udoka Azubuike added 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Silvio De Sousa finished with 11 points and eight rebounds.</p>
<p>The Hoosiers were led by Romeo Langford, who had 21 points on 9-of-15 shooting. Juwan Morgan added 20 points and eight rebounds, and Langford’s former high school teammate Robert Phinisee scored 14 points off the bench.</p>
<p>Kansas got off to a hot start, opening up a 17-point lead in the first half. But Indiana came storming back in the second half, using a 28-9 run to take a 62-50 lead. The Jayhawks made one final push late in the game but couldn’t overcome the deficit.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing loss for Kansas, who will now need to regroup before their next game against Louisiana Monroe on November 28th.</p>
<h1 id="Jayhawks-Can’t-Hold-Off-Late-Rally"><a href="#Jayhawks-Can’t-Hold-Off-Late-Rally" class="headerlink" title="Jayhawks Can’t Hold Off Late Rally"></a>Jayhawks Can’t Hold Off Late Rally</h1><p>LAWRENCE, Kan. – No. 3 Kansas was unable to hold off a late rally by No. 10 Oklahoma State and fell 85-80 on Feb. 2 at Allen Fieldhouse.</p>
<p>Kansas (22-3, 11-1 Big 12) led by as many as 16 points in the second half, but the Cowboys (19-5, 8-4 Big 12) came back to take the lead with just over two minutes left to play. KU freshman guard Quentin Grimes scored a career-high 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting to lead the Jayhawks, while junior center Udoka Azubuike added 17 points and seven rebounds. OSU’s Jeffrey Carroll led all scorers with 30 points on 9-of-15 shooting, including 6-of-9 from 3-point range.</p>
<p>The Jayhawks got off to a slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half en route to a 40-34 halftime lead. Oklahoma State gradually closed the gap in the second half, using a 14-2 run to take its first lead of the game at 68-67 with 5:39 remaining. The Jayhawks briefly regained the lead before OSU went on another run to take control of the game.</p>
<p>Kansas will look to get back on track when it travels to face Baylor on Feb. 5 at 6 p.m. Central on ESPNU</p>
<h1 id="Bumps-in-the-Road-Ahead-for-Kansas"><a href="#Bumps-in-the-Road-Ahead-for-Kansas" class="headerlink" title="Bumps in the Road Ahead for Kansas?"></a>Bumps in the Road Ahead for Kansas?</h1><p>In the wake of the 2016 elections, it seemed that Kansas was on the rise. The state, which had been solidly red for years, swung to support Donald Trump – and with it, a Republican governor and legislature. But in the first months of 2018, it’s looking like things may not be going as well as hoped.</p>
<p>Tax cuts were a key part of the Republicans’ platform in Kansas, and they moved quickly to pass legislation slashing rates. The hope was that this would jumpstart the economy and lead to more jobs and prosperity. But while individual taxpayers may have seen some relief, the overall result has been disastrous. Tax revenue has plummeted, leading to budget shortfalls and cuts in critical services. And while job growth has been somewhat stronger than in other states, it has not been enough to make up for lost revenue.</p>
<p>As a result, Kansas is facing a crisis. Schools are struggling to afford basic supplies, roads are crumbling, and health care is becoming increasingly unaffordable. The state is also facing lawsuits from disgruntled citizens who have seen their quality of life decline drastically since the tax cuts were passed.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what can be done to fix things at this point. The Republicans who control the state government seem determined to stick with their failed policies, even as the consequences become more and more obvious. Meanwhile, the Democrats lack any real power to bring about change.</p>
<p>Kansas is in for a rough ride in the years ahead – unless something changes soon.</p>
