        <h1 id="NBA-Paris-betting-update-What-does-ET-mean"><a href="#NBA-Paris-betting-update-What-does-ET-mean" class="headerlink" title="NBA Paris betting update: What does ET mean?"></a>NBA Paris betting update: What does ET mean?</h1><p>The NBA has been gaining a lot of attention in the past few years, and with the number of overseas players increasing, it was only a matter of time until we saw an NBA game being played in a different continent. That day arrived on January 16th, when the Toronto Raptors took on the Orlando Magic at the AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France.</p>
<p>Despite being the “away” team, the Raptors were dominant and won 111-82. But what does this game mean for NBA betting? Well, for one, it’s likely that we’ll see more and more games being played in Europe and other continents in the near future. This could lead to some interesting new betting opportunities for those looking to take advantage of different odds.</p>
<p>However, one thing to note is that because these games are being played in different time zones (ET), there will be some adjusting that needs to be done when trying to calculate odds. For example, if you’re used to betting on games that start at 10pm EST, you’ll need to account for the fact that these games will start at either 7pm or 9pm Paris time. If you’re not aware of how to convert between time zones, there are numerous online tools available that can help make things easier.</p>
<p>Overall, the NBA’s foray into Europe is definitely something to watch out for, as it could lead to some interesting new betting opportunities down the road.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-favourites-in-the-Paris-NBA-betting"><a href="#Who-are-the-favourites-in-the-Paris-NBA-betting" class="headerlink" title="Who are the favourites in the Paris NBA betting?"></a>Who are the favourites in the Paris NBA betting?</h1><p>There is no clear favourite in the Paris NBA betting, with several teams having a realistic chance of winning the title. The Golden State Warriors are typically seen as one of the front runners, but they will have to overcome the challenge posed by teams such as the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>The Cavs were beaten by the Warriors in last year’s Finals, but they will be looking to make amends this season. LeBron James is still one of the best players in the NBA and he has some excellent team-mates around him. Kyrie Irving is a superstar in his own right and he will be looking to take his game to another level this season.</p>
<p>The Celtics have made some impressive signings in the summer transfer window, with Gordon Hayward and Jayson Tatum among those joining the team. Hayward is a proven winner and he should help to make the Celtics a force to be reckoned with this season.</p>
<p>Other teams who could make an impact in Paris include the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder and San Antonio Spurs. Each of these teams has a number of star players who could lead them to glory in France.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-odds-for-the-Paris-NBA-games"><a href="#What-are-the-odds-for-the-Paris-NBA-games" class="headerlink" title="What are the odds for the Paris NBA games?"></a>What are the odds for the Paris NBA games?</h1><p>The NBA season is underway and the Paris fans are excited to see their home team in action. The games are scheduled for early December, and the odds have just been released for the matchups.</p>
<p>The first game is set for December 3 against the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks are a strong team and are expected to win this game. They have odds of -600, while the home team has odds of +450. This means that if you bet $600 on the Bucks, you would win $100 if they win. If you bet $100 on the home team, you would win $450 if they win.</p>
<p>The next game is scheduled for December 5 against the Boston Celtics. The Celtics are also considered a strong team and are expected to win this game as well. They have odds of -650, while the home team has odds of +425. So, if you bet $650 on the Celtics, you would win $100 if they win. If you bet $100 on the home team, you would win $425 if they win.</p>
<p>The final game in Paris is scheduled for December 7 against the Atlanta Hawks. The Hawks are not considered as strong as the other two teams, but they still pose a threat. The odds for this game are at -225 for the Hawks and +185 for the home team. Thus, if you bet $225 on the Hawks, you would profit $100 if they won. If you bet $100 on the home team, then you would profit $185 if they won.</p>

However, it is also becoming a mecca for sports betting, and the NBA is no exception. Here are the latest odds and tips to help you make some winning bets on the Paris basketball scene.</p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind when betting on the NBA in Paris is that the lines can be different than what you would find in other parts of the world. So before you put down any money, be sure to do your research and find out where the best odds are.</p>
<p>There are a few teams that are consistently popular with Paris NBA bettors. The Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers are always big contenders, as are the LA Lakers and Boston Celtics. But don’t forget about up-and-coming teams like the Oklahoma City Thunder either – they could provide some good betting opportunities this season.</p>
<p>When it comes to betting on individual games, there are a few things to consider. The first is obviously who is going to win, but there are also points spreads and over&#x2F;under bets to think about. And if you’re feeling really daring, you can even bet on who will score first or last.</p>
<p>As with any type of gambling, always remember to never bet more than you can afford to lose. With a little bit of luck and some sound research, though, you could be cashing in on some big NBA wins in Paris!</p>
<h1 id="Complete-guide-to-NBA-Paris-betting"><a href="#Complete-guide-to-NBA-Paris-betting" class="headerlink" title="Complete guide to NBA Paris betting"></a>Complete guide to NBA Paris betting</h1><p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) is known as one of the most competitive sports leagues in the world. This makes it a popular choice for betting, with a wide range of bets available on each game. Paris offers some great NBA betting options, so let’s take a look at how to bet on the NBA and some of the best bets you can make.</p>
<p>There are three main ways to bet on the NBA – match winner, point spread and totals. Match winner bets are simple, you just pick which team you think will win the game. Point spread bets are more complex, as you are predicting how many points one team will beat another by. Totals are also popular, as you are predicting how many points will be scored in the game in total. There are a huge range of other bets available too, such as who will score most points, first team to reach 100 points and much more.</p>
<p>Paris offers some great odds for NBA betting, so it’s worth taking a look at what’s available before placing any bets. There are often good odds available on matches where one team is heavily favoured to win, or when there is a big disparity between the teams in terms of ability. Totals offer especially good value most of the time, as predicting whether or not both teams will score over a certain number of points can be tough.</p>
<p>So, now you know how to bet on the NBA and what kind of bets are available. Here are four tips to help increase your chances of winning:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do your research – this is especially important when betting on totals. Make sure you know how well each team plays offensively and defensively, as this will give you an idea of how likely it is that they will achieve over&#x2F;under total scores.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use multiple betting sites – this allows you to compare odds and find the best value for your money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Follow tipsters – there are plenty of experts out there who offer free tips for NBA betting. Following their advice can help increase your chances of making money from betting on basketball games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of injuries – injuries can have a big impact on games, so it’s important to stay up-to-date with all the latest news before placing any bets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
