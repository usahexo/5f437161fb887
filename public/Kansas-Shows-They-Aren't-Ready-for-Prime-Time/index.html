        <h1 id="Kansas-Shows-They-Aren’t-Ready-for-Prime-Time"><a href="#Kansas-Shows-They-Aren’t-Ready-for-Prime-Time" class="headerlink" title="Kansas Shows They Aren’t Ready for Prime Time"></a>Kansas Shows They Aren’t Ready for Prime Time</h1><p>The Kansas Jayhawks basketball team had a disappointing season, finishing with a 25-10 record. The biggest disappointment was their early exit from the NCAA Tournament. They were upset by No. 14 seed Penn in the first round.</p>
<p>It was clear that this team wasn’t ready to compete at the highest level. They lacked depth and talent, especially on the wings. Devonte’ Graham was their only player who could create his own shot.</p>
<p>The Jayhawks struggled against good teams all year long. They lost to Arizona State, Texas Tech, Oklahoma and West Virginia. They also had close losses to Baylor and Syracuse.</p>
<p>There are definitely some things that need to be fixed if this team wants to make a run in the NCAA Tournament next year. They need more scorers and they need to improve their defensive play.</p>
<p>One positive for the Jayhawks is that they should be able to return all of their core players next year. This includes Graham, Svi Mykhailiuk, Udoka Azubuike and Lagerald Vick. If they can add a few key players in the offseason, they could be a force to be reckoned with in 2019-20.</p>
<h1 id="A-Rough-Night-for-the-Jayhawks"><a href="#A-Rough-Night-for-the-Jayhawks" class="headerlink" title="A Rough Night for the Jayhawks"></a>A Rough Night for the Jayhawks</h1><p>The Jayhawks stumbled to a 96-58 home loss to No. 10 Texas Tech on Tuesday night. It was the worst home loss under head coach Bill Self and the second-worst loss in school history.</p>
<p>Kansas (15-5, 5-3 Big 12) was never in the game, as Texas Tech (19-2, 7-1) raced out to a 28-point halftime lead and cruised from there. The Red Raiders shot 59 percent from the field, including 66 percent in the first half.</p>
<p>“We embarrassed Kansas tonight,” Self said. “I don’t know how else to put it. They whipped us from start to finish in every phase of the game. We were bad offensively and defensively and we didn’t do anything well at all.”</p>
<p>Devin Booker led Kansas with 18 points while Perry Ellis added 15. But no other Jayhawk scored more than six points as Texas Tech completely dominated down low, outscoring Kansas 44-16 in the paint.</p>
<p>This was easily the worst performance of the season for Kansas, which now falls into a tie for third place in the Big 12 standings. The Jayhawks will look to rebound on Saturday when they travel to Oklahoma State.</p>
<h1 id="Kansas-Struggles-in-Second-Half"><a href="#Kansas-Struggles-in-Second-Half" class="headerlink" title="Kansas Struggles in Second Half"></a>Kansas Struggles in Second Half</h1><p>In their second game of the season, the Kansas Jayhawks found themselves in a battle with the Indiana Hoosiers. Trailing by as many as 14 in the second half, the Jayhawks made a furious comeback but fell just short, losing 92-87.</p>
<p>Freshman Devon Dotson led the way for Kansas, scoring a team-high 27 points on 10-of-16 shooting. Udoka Azubuike added 19 points and 10 rebounds, and Silvio De Sousa finished with 11 points and eight rebounds.</p>
<p>The Hoosiers were led by Romeo Langford, who had 21 points on 9-of-15 shooting. Juwan Morgan added 20 points and eight rebounds, and Langford’s former high school teammate Robert Phinisee scored 14 points off the bench.</p>
<p>Kansas got off to a hot start, opening up a 17-point lead in the first half. But Indiana came storming back in the second half, using a 28-9 run to take a 62-50 lead. The Jayhawks made one final push late in the game but couldn’t overcome the deficit.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing loss for Kansas, who will now need to regroup before their next game against Louisiana Monroe on November 28th.</p>
<h1 id="Jayhawks-Can’t-Hold-Off-Late-Rally"><a href="#Jayhawks-Can’t-Hold-Off-Late-Rally" class="headerlink" title="Jayhawks Can’t Hold Off Late Rally"></a>Jayhawks Can’t Hold Off Late Rally</h1><p>LAWRENCE, Kan. – No. 3 Kansas was unable to hold off a late rally by No. 10 Oklahoma State and fell 85-80 on Feb. 2 at Allen Fieldhouse.</p>
<p>Kansas (22-3, 11-1 Big 12) led by as many as 16 points in the second half, but the Cowboys (19-5, 8-4 Big 12) came back to take the lead with just over two minutes left to play. KU freshman guard Quentin Grimes scored a career-high 29 points on 11-of-18 shooting to lead the Jayhawks, while junior center Udoka Azubuike added 17 points and seven rebounds. OSU’s Jeffrey Carroll led all scorers with 30 points on 9-of-15 shooting, including 6-of-9 from 3-point range.</p>
<p>The Jayhawks got off to a slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half en route to a 40-34 halftime lead. Oklahoma State gradually closed the gap in the second half, using a 14-2 run to take its first lead of the game at 68-67 with 5:39 remaining. The Jayhawks briefly regained the lead before OSU went on another run to take control of the game.</p>
<p>Kansas will look to get back on track when it travels to face Baylor on Feb. 5 at 6 p.m. Central on ESPNU</p>
<h1 id="Bumps-in-the-Road-Ahead-for-Kansas"><a href="#Bumps-in-the-Road-Ahead-for-Kansas" class="headerlink" title="Bumps in the Road Ahead for Kansas?"></a>Bumps in the Road Ahead for Kansas?</h1><p>In the wake of the 2016 elections, it seemed that Kansas was on the rise. The state, which had been solidly red for years, swung to support Donald Trump – and with it, a Republican governor and legislature. But in the first months of 2018, it’s looking like things may not be going as well as hoped.</p>
<p>Tax cuts were a key part of the Republicans’ platform in Kansas, and they moved quickly to pass legislation slashing rates. The hope was that this would jumpstart the economy and lead to more jobs and prosperity. But while individual taxpayers may have seen some relief, the overall result has been disastrous. Tax revenue has plummeted, leading to budget shortfalls and cuts in critical services. And while job growth has been somewhat stronger than in other states, it has not been enough to make up for lost revenue.</p>
<p>As a result, Kansas is facing a crisis. Schools are struggling to afford basic supplies, roads are crumbling, and health care is becoming increasingly unaffordable. The state is also facing lawsuits from disgruntled citizens who have seen their quality of life decline drastically since the tax cuts were passed.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what can be done to fix things at this point. The Republicans who control the state government seem determined to stick with their failed policies, even as the consequences become more and more obvious. Meanwhile, the Democrats lack any real power to bring about change.</p>
<p>Kansas is in for a rough ride in the years ahead – unless something changes soon.</p>
