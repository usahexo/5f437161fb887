<p>The new rules, which have been drawn up by the state of Illinois, would see casino dealers forced to share their tips with other members of staff. This would include people like security guards and cleaners, who are not traditionally given tips by casino dealers.</p>
<p>The proposed rules have attracted a great deal of criticism from casino employees, who argue that it is unfair for them to be forced to share their tips with people who don’t usually receive them.</p>
<p>Dealers also argue that the new rules could lead to them receiving less money in tips overall. This is because customers may be less likely to leave a tip if they know that it will be shared amongst a number of people.</p>
<p>In response to the proposed rules, casino dealers across Illinois have started talks about going on strike. A spokesman for the dealers said: “We are not currently striking, but we are talking about it. We believe this is a very serious issue and we are not going to stand for it.”</p>
<p>The spokesman added that the dealers are planning to hold a vote on whether or not to go on strike in the near future. If they do decide to strike, it is unclear how long the action will last for.</p>
<p>The proposed new rules come at a time when US casinos are facing increasing competition from overseas operators. In order to compete, casinos in Illinois need to find ways to reduce costs and increase efficiency. Introducing rules that force dealers to share their tips with other members of staff may be one way of achieving this.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Workers-Union-Says-Proposed-New-Gambling-Rules-Are-Unworkable"><a href="#Casino-Workers-Union-Says-Proposed-New-Gambling-Rules-Are-Unworkable" class="headerlink" title="Casino Workers Union Says Proposed New Gambling Rules Are Unworkable"></a>Casino Workers Union Says Proposed New Gambling Rules Are Unworkable</h1><p>The proposed new gambling rules have been labelled as unworkable by the casino workers union. The new rules, which were proposed by the government, would see a reduction in the number of casinos in the country and would also see a change in the way that casino workers are employed.</p>
<p>The casino workers union has said that the proposed changes are not feasible and would lead to job losses and a reduction in the number of casinos in the country. They have also said that the government has not consulted with them about these changes and that they were only made aware of them through the media.</p>
<p>The casino workers union has said that it is willing to negotiate with the government about these proposed changes, but that they first need more information about what is being proposed. They have asked for a meeting with the government so that they can discuss these proposals further.</p>
<p>The government has said that it is still consulting with various stakeholders about these proposed changes and that no final decisions have been made yet. It is expected that a decision will be made in the next few months about whether or not these changes will be implemented.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Kickstarter-a-Form-of-Gambling-the-View-from-the-Casino-Floor"><a href="#Is-Kickstarter-a-Form-of-Gambling-the-View-from-the-Casino-Floor" class="headerlink" title="Is Kickstarter a Form of Gambling? the View from the Casino Floor"></a>Is Kickstarter a Form of Gambling? the View from the Casino Floor</h1><p>Innovation is the lifeblood of the casino industry. Just when you think gaming has reached its peak, a new game or technology comes along to redefine how we play. Slot machines, for example, used to be mechanical devices, with reels that spun and stopping on winning combinations. Now they are computerized, with randomized outcomes and dozens of possible bonus rounds.</p>
<p>So it was only a matter of time before online casinos started appearing, and in 2004 the first one opened its virtual doors. A few years later, in 2009, Kickstarter burst onto the scene, and soon people were using it to fund all manner of creative projects.</p>
<p>At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be much similarity between casinos and Kickstarter. But on closer inspection, I believe there are some parallels that can be drawn. Let’s take a look at some of them.</p>
<p>One similarity is that both casinos and Kickstarter involve risk-taking. When you gamble in a casino, you are betting your money on the chance that you will win more than you lose. And when you back a project on Kickstarter, you are investing in something that may not succeed – after all, only about 44% of projects reach their funding goals.</p>
<p>Another similarity is that both casinos and Kickstarter can be addictive. For some people, gambling can become a compulsive behavior, and they can’t resist the urge to keep playing no matter how much money they lose. The same is true for people who get hooked on backing Kickstarter projects – they can’t help but keep contributing money even when there’s no guarantee they will see any return on their investment.</p>
<p>A third similarity is that both casinos and Kickstarter can be thrilling experiences. The excitement of gambling comes from the risk-reward dynamic: the chance to win big money for a small bet is an adrenaline rush like no other. And for backers of Kickstarter projects, the thrill comes from watching their chosen project come to life and knowing they helped make it happen.</p>
<p>Finally, both casinos and Kickstarter can be fun ways to spend time with friends and family. Gambling can be a social activity, especially when played in groups, and backers often enjoy talking about the projects they’ve funded and sharing pictures and updates as they progress.</p>
<p>So do casinos and Kickstarter have anything in common? I believe they do – mainly because both involve risk-taking, addiction potential, thrills, fun, and socializing. Whether or not this is a good thing is up for debate; what’s clear is that these similarities make it worth examining casino culture through the lens of Kickstarter trends.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Senate-Panel-Approves-Bill-to-Regulate-and-Tax-Crowdfunding-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Senate-Panel-Approves-Bill-to-Regulate-and-Tax-Crowdfunding-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Senate Panel Approves Bill to Regulate and Tax Crowdfunding Gambling"></a>Nevada Senate Panel Approves Bill to Regulate and Tax Crowdfunding Gambling</h1><p>CARSON CITY — A state Senate panel on Tuesday approved a measure that would regulate and tax gambling by nonprofits through crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The bill, SB471, now goes to the full Senate for consideration. It would establish a regulatory framework for nonprofit organizations to conduct raffles and lotteries online.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding gambling would be limited to nonprofit groups and their members, with each member allowed to contribute no more than $100 per year. The Nevada Gaming Control Board would set the amount of the tax, which could not exceed 10 percent of the gross revenue generated from the gambling.</p>
<p>Sen. Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, said the bill is needed to permit and regulate internet gambling by nonprofit organizations that already are conducting such games illegally. He said the measure also would generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents said there is no need for more gambling in Nevada and it could lead to more problems with addiction. </p>
<p>Nevada has always been a leader in gambling innovation and this bill is just another example of that. If passed, SB471 would allow nonprofit organizations to conduct raffles and lotteries online in a safe and regulated environment. This would include specifying what games are allowed, how much individuals can contribute per year, and most importantly – setting a tax rate on the gross revenue generated from these activities.<br>Allowing crowdfunding gambling will not only provide extra revenue for Nevada but it will also create jobs in the casino industry – an industry that is currently struggling due to the recession. Gambling is a social activity that has been around for centuries and I believe that SB471 will be a positive addition to our state’s gaming laws</p>

Many dealers have taken to social media to vent about the way they’re being treated, and some are even considering quitting their jobs.</p>
<p>One dealer, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s really frustrating. We’re not here to be abused - we’re here to help people enjoy their time and hopefully win some money. But we’re constantly being yelled at and treated like we’re nothing. It’s really demoralizing.”</p>
<p>Another dealer, Leslie Steinberg, said that she was often ignored by customers when trying to help them: “They’ll just glare at me and act like I’m not even there. It’s really disrespectful.”</p>
<p>Dealers aren’t the only ones who feel this way - cocktail waitresses and other casino staff have also voiced their complaints about the way they’re being treated by customers. Some are even considering leaving their jobs because of it.</p>
<p>Casino officials say that they are aware of the issue and are working on ways to improve customer relations. In the meantime, however, employees continue to feel undervalued and unappreciated</p>
