For years, they have called AT&amp;T Park their home, but that is all changing in 2020.</p>
<p>The Giants have just announced that they are moving to Las Vegas and will be calling a new stadium, The Strip Ballpark, their home starting in 2020.</p>
<p>This move has come as a bit of a surprise to many people, as the team has always been closely tied to the Bay Area. But with a declining fan base and a need for a new stadium, the Giants decided it was time for a change.</p>
<p>The Strip Ballpark is set to be one of the most luxurious stadiums in all of baseball. It will have a retractable roof, ensuring that games can be played in any weather, and it will also feature a pool and several other luxury amenities.</p>
<p>The move to Nevada is sure to excite fans in Sin City, who have never had their own MLB team before. The Giants are hoping that this move will reinvigorate their fan base and help them compete with other teams in the Western Division.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Governor-Brian-Sandoval-Announces-Dodgers-as-First-Professional-Team-to-Sign-for-Las-Vegas-Athletics-Franchise"><a href="#Nevada-Governor-Brian-Sandoval-Announces-Dodgers-as-First-Professional-Team-to-Sign-for-Las-Vegas-Athletics-Franchise" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval Announces Dodgers as First Professional Team to Sign for Las Vegas Athletics Franchise"></a>Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval Announces Dodgers as First Professional Team to Sign for Las Vegas Athletics Franchise</h1><p>Today, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval announced that the Dodgers have become the first professional sports team to sign on to the Las Vegas Athletics franchise.</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval made the announcement at a press conference inside of the newly renovated Howard Hughes Center in Summerlin. Joining the Governor at today’s press conference was Stan Kasten, President of Business Operations for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and officials from The Madison Square Garden Company, which is leading development of the new Las Vegas Athletics stadium.</p>
<p>“This is a momentous day for our community and for baseball fans all over Southern Nevada,” said Governor Sandoval. “We are excited to welcome the Dodgers as our first professional team to sign on to play in our new stadium. They are one of the most successful and well-known franchises in Major League Baseball, and we are thrilled to have them as part of our team.”</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Athletics stadium is scheduled to open in time for the 2020 season, with construction set to begin this year. The state-of-the-art facility will feature a retractable roof and be located in Downtown Summerlin near the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa.</p>
<p>“We are proud to partner with The Madison Square Garden Company as we bring a world-class athletics franchise to Las Vegas,” said Governor Sandoval. “This stadium will be a major attraction for our community, and I look forward to watching future generations of athletes compete here.”</p>
<p>Added Stan Kasten: “On behalf of the entire Dodger organization, I want to express our excitement in joining Las Vegas Athletics as their inaugural professional team. This is an exceptional community that has demonstrated its commitment to providing top-quality entertainment options for its residents and visitors alike.”</p>
<h1 id="San-Francisco-Giants-Draw-Huge-Payouts-Ahead-of-Planned-Move-to-Nevada"><a href="#San-Francisco-Giants-Draw-Huge-Payouts-Ahead-of-Planned-Move-to-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="San Francisco Giants Draw Huge Payouts Ahead of Planned Move to Nevada"></a>San Francisco Giants Draw Huge Payouts Ahead of Planned Move to Nevada</h1><p>The San Francisco Giants, a professional baseball team, are making the move to Nevada in 2020. The team is set to receive $450 million in taxpayer money for their new stadium, which is more than any other team has ever received. Critics argue that the team should have paid for the stadium themselves, as taxpayers will now be footing the bill for what is sure to be an expensive project.</p>
<p>The Giants aren’t the only ones who are benefiting from this move; the Las Vegas Raiders, a professional football team, are also set to receive $750 million in taxpayer money for their new stadium. This has caused some to question why two sports teams are being given so much money when schools and other public services are facing cuts.</p>
<p>Some argue that the Raiders and Giants moves will bring jobs and economic growth to Nevada. However, there is no evidence that either of these things will actually happen. In fact, there is evidence that suggests the exact opposite may be true. For example, the San Francisco 49ers moved to Santa Clara in 2014 and have since seen their profits decline.</p>
<p>Taxpayers should not be responsible for footing the bill for stadiums owned by billionaires. It’s time for sports teams to start paying their own way.</p>
<h1 id="Athletics-Franchise-in-Las-Vegas-a-Win-Win-for-All-Involved"><a href="#Athletics-Franchise-in-Las-Vegas-a-Win-Win-for-All-Involved" class="headerlink" title="Athletics Franchise in Las Vegas a Win-Win for All Involved"></a>Athletics Franchise in Las Vegas a Win-Win for All Involved</h1><p>A new athletics franchise in Las Vegas is a win-win for all involved, from the city and its residents to the team’s players and fans. The Oakland Raiders are relocating to Las Vegas and will become the city’s first professional sports team.</p>
<p>The Raiders have pledged $500 million to the project, and the state of Nevada has pledged another $750 million in public money. In addition, billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson has pledged another $650 million. That’s a lot of money, but it will be worth it.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is a great city that is only getting better. With a population of 2 million people and counting, it is already the largest city in Nevada and one of the largest in the United States. It is also a major tourist destination, with more than 42 million visitors each year.</p>
<p>The new athletics franchise will help to drive even more tourism dollars into the city. Its arrival will also help to increase real estate values and spur economic development in other areas of town. And with thousands of passionate fans, the new franchise is sure to be a big success both on and off the field.</p>
<h1 id="San-Francisco-Giants’-Departure-Plans-Turn-Heads-in-Nevada"><a href="#San-Francisco-Giants’-Departure-Plans-Turn-Heads-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="San Francisco Giants’ Departure Plans Turn Heads in Nevada"></a>San Francisco Giants’ Departure Plans Turn Heads in Nevada</h1><p>A recent bombshell dropped by the San Francisco Giants organization rocked the city of Las Vegas and its baseball team, the 51s.</p>
<p>The Giants announced their intention to leave Candlestick Park at the end of the season and move to a new stadium in Santa Clara, California. The news was not warmly received in Nevada.</p>
<p>Officials from the Las Vegas 51s, the Triple-A affiliate of the Giants, were blindsided by the announcement. “We had no idea this was even a possibility,” said Don Logan, president of Mandalay Baseball Properties, which operates Cashman Field and also owns the 51s. “It came as a complete surprise.”</p>
<p>Logan went on to say that he felt betrayed by his counterparts in San Francisco. “We’ve been a great partner for them,” he said. “This is just really lousy etiquette.”</p>
<p>The departure of the Giants will be a huge loss for Cashman Field, which has depended on their presence to help draw fans. The 51s have averaged more than 9,000 fans per game this season, compared with just 4,600 last year.</p>
<p>Giants officials said their new stadium will have about 42,000 seats, compared with Candlestick Park’s capacity of about 69,000. They also noted that Santa Clara is much closer to their fan base in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Teams in minor league baseball must have agreements with major league clubs in order to operate. It’s not clear what effect the Giants’ departure will have on the 51s, but it’s likely that another major league team will be found to take their place.</p>
