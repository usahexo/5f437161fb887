        <h1 id="Mornar-Beats-Lakers-as-Sports-Bettors-Cash-In"><a href="#Mornar-Beats-Lakers-as-Sports-Bettors-Cash-In" class="headerlink" title="Mornar Beats Lakers as Sports Bettors Cash In"></a>Mornar Beats Lakers as Sports Bettors Cash In</h1><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers welcomed LeBron James back to his old stomping grounds on Wednesday night, and the sports books were happy to see him beaten.</p>
<p>Bettors wagered heavily on the Lakers in the wake of James’ announcement that he was returning to Los Angeles, and Mornar delivered with a 107-86 victory. The Cavs closed as 7.5-point underdogs, meaning they produced a nice return for those who backed them.</p>
<p>Sports books also won big on Thursday night’s game between the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics. The Warriors were 14-point favorites and cruised to a 109-103 victory, covering the spread easily. That result produced another winning night for bettors backing the home team.</p>
<p>Overall, it has been a good week for sports books in Las Vegas. They are up more than $1 million on NBA games so far this season, and they appear poised to collect again on Friday night when the Houston Rockets visit the Utah Jazz.</p>
<h1 id="How-NBA-Sports-Betting-Works-A-Look-at-Point-Spreads"><a href="#How-NBA-Sports-Betting-Works-A-Look-at-Point-Spreads" class="headerlink" title="How NBA Sports Betting Works: A Look at Point Spreads"></a>How NBA Sports Betting Works: A Look at Point Spreads</h1><p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in America, and there’s a lot of money to be made on it legally by betting on the games. In this article, we’re going to take a look at how NBA point spreads work so that you can start making some money on your own.</p>
<p>Point spreads are the most common way to bet on basketball games. When you see a point spread, it means that one team is favored by a certain number of points over the other team. So, if Team A is favored by 5 points, that means they need to win by more than 5 points for their backers (people who bet on them) to win their bets. If Team B is underdog, then their backers will win if they either win outright or lose by fewer than 5 points.</p>
<p>The odds associated with point spreads vary depending on how likely the bookmakers think each outcome is. In general, favorites will have lower odds than underdogs. For example, if Team A is favored by 5 points, then their backers might get paid out at odds of -110. This means that they would have to risk $110 to win $100. Underdog backers would get paid at +160, which means that they would risk $100 to win $160.</p>
<p>There are also other types of bets that can be placed on basketball games in addition to point spreads. These include totals (over&#x2F;unders), moneylines, and parlays. Totals are bets placed on the total number of points scored in a game by both teams combined. Moneylines are bets placed on which team will win the game straight-up without accounting for the point spread. Parlays are multiple bets put together into one wager. All of the individual bets within a parlay must win for the parlay bettor to receive a payout.</p>
<p>Now that you know how NBA point spreads work, give it a try yourself! There’s plenty of money to be made if you know what you’re doing.</p>
<h1 id="The-Rockets-rout-the-76ers-NBA-sports-betting-continues-to-thrive"><a href="#The-Rockets-rout-the-76ers-NBA-sports-betting-continues-to-thrive" class="headerlink" title="The Rockets rout the 76ers -NBA sports betting continues to thrive"></a>The Rockets rout the 76ers -NBA sports betting continues to thrive</h1><p>This series has been quite one-sided, with Houston winning the first three games by an average of 19.7 points. The fourth game was closer, but Houston pulled away in the second half and won 122-103.</p>
<p>Houston is now one win away from advancing to the next round, while Philadelphia will need a miracle to come back. The odds of that happening are not good, as they are currently +10000 to win the series.</p>
<p>Houston is a heavy favorite to win Game 5, as they are listed at -550 on most sports betting sites. Philadelphia is at +400, while the odds of a sweep are at +125. Tuesday’s game is scheduled for 8 PM ET at the Toyota Center in Houston.</p>
<p>This series has been great for NBA sports betting fans, as it has provided plenty of excitement and big wins. The Rockets have looked like a dominant force, while the 76ers have struggled mightily.</p>
<p>The Rockets will look to close out the series on Tuesday night and move on to face either Golden State or San Antonio in the next round.</p>
<h1 id="Durant-Leads-Warriors-to-Third-Straight-Win-NBA-Sports-Betting-Continues-to-Surge"><a href="#Durant-Leads-Warriors-to-Third-Straight-Win-NBA-Sports-Betting-Continues-to-Surge" class="headerlink" title="Durant Leads Warriors to Third Straight Win; NBA Sports Betting Continues to Surge"></a>Durant Leads Warriors to Third Straight Win; NBA Sports Betting Continues to Surge</h1><p>Kevin Durant scored a game-high 33 points and the Golden State Warriors held on to win their third straight game with a 116-110 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. The win moves the Warriors to 11-3 on the season and they remain the prohibitive favorites to take home the NBA championship this season. </p>
<p>The NBA betting landscape has shifted considerably since Durant made his decision to join the Warriors in free agency. The odds of Golden State winning the title have steadily risen, while the odds of every other team have plummeted. In fact, only four teams (Warriors, Spurs, Rockets, Celtics) currently have odds of winning the title that are lower than 10%. </p>
<p>Part of what has made Durant’s move so successful is his ability to mesh with Stephen Curry and company. The Warriors are now one of the most potent offenses in league history, averaging 120 points per game this season. They are also one of the most efficient teams, shooting over 50% from the field as a team. </p>
<p>Curry continues to be one of the best players in the league and is having another MVP-caliber season. He is averaging 28 points per game while shooting over 40% from three-point range. Klay Thompson is also having a stellar year, averaging 21 points per game while shooting nearly 45% from beyond the arc. </p>
<p>The addition of Durant has given Golden State a virtually insurmountable lead in the Western Conference. Their closest competition at this point is likely the Houston Rockets, who are led by superstar guard James Harden. The Rockets have been impressive this year as well, but they do not have quite as much firepower as Golden State. </p>
<p>It appears that barring a major injury, there is very little that can stop the Warriors from making their fourth consecutive Finals appearance and claiming their third championship in four years.</p>
<h1 id="The-Golden-State-Warriors-Win-Again-NBA-Sports-Bettors-Continue-to-Profit"><a href="#The-Golden-State-Warriors-Win-Again-NBA-Sports-Bettors-Continue-to-Profit" class="headerlink" title="The Golden State Warriors Win Again, NBA Sports Bettors Continue to Profit"></a>The Golden State Warriors Win Again, NBA Sports Bettors Continue to Profit</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors are continuing their torrid pace and have now won 15 in a row. This is bad news for the teams they are playing, but great news for NBA sports bettors.</p>
<p>Against the spread, the Warriors have now gone 12-3 and the over&#x2F;under has hit in 10 of their last 12 games. Considering how high the over&#x2F;under has been for Warriors games this season, these numbers are not too surprising.</p>
<p>What might be more surprising is that the public is still backing Golden State at such a high rate. As of Wednesday morning, 77% of all bets placed on the Warriors’ game against the Sacramento Kings were on Golden State -6.5 point favorites.</p>
<p>This data shows that there is still value to be found when betting against the Warriors. Smart NBA bettors will continue to back underdogs when Golden State is in action, while still enjoying the profits that come with betting on the Warriors straight up or taking them over the total.</p>
